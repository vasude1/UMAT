@article{Christensen1979,
abstract = {The Grittith instability criterion for crack propagation is generalized to provide a criterion for time- dependent crack growth. Our procedure is similar to that of Griltith in its use of a global energy balance. The Grittith method is generalized by the inclusion of the rate-of-energy dissipation term in the balance law. This rate-of-dissipation term is derived to represent the behavior of viscoelastic materials; thus the final results are applicable primarily to polymeric behavior. Our final results are concise analytical expressions [Eqns. (50)] for crack velocity as a function of the creep properties of the material, the level of loading, and the energy or work content of the crack-generated new surface. These analytical solutions are quite general; the primary restriction occurs because they are derived under asymptotic conditions of high- and low-crack velocities. Finally, we compare the analytical predictions with experimental results for a polyurethane elastomer.},

@article{Huber2000,
abstract = {It is proved that two different decompositions of strain may be assigned to every linear viscoelastic solid. In particular, this is true for the so-called three-parameter solids. For this case, the two decompositions of deformation are in a natural way associated with the two well known spring-dashpot models, the first one being a spring in parallel with a Maxwell element and the second model consisting of a spring in series with a Kelvin element. Furthermore, it is shown how the two decompositions of deformation may be generalized to finite deformations in the framework of a multi-plicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor. This enables to assign to each version of the three-parameter solids a corresponding class of finite deformation counterparts. Note that the finite deformation models are derived so, that the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied for every admissible process. To this end, use is made of the so-called Mandel stress tensor. As one may expect, unlike the linear case, the finite deformation models obtained do not predict identical mechanical responses generally. This is illustrated for the loading case of uniaxial tension-compression. Also, an analysis of the model responses for simple shear is given.},

@article{Runesson2009,
abstract = {The appropriate thermodynamic setting for the combined configurational and deformational motion of standard continua is discussed in this paper. A key ingredient is an absolute (fixed) reference configuration, relative to which configurational and deformational changes (rates) with respect to the material (undeformed) and spatial (deformed) configurations, respectively, can be described in a unified fashion. In particular, we are interested in formulating the local as well as global measures of the energy dissipation due to configurational changes of a given physical system. It is believed that the presentation in this paper provides the following advantages: a unified kinematic and thermodynamic setting of the configurational and deformational motions, in particular the generic balance law accounting for configurational flux, increases the general clarity; the separation of the total dissipation in terms of the intrinsic change in elastic energy and in terms of the material dissipation that is induced by configurational changes becomes transparent.

@article{Moran1987a,
abstract = {A unified derivation of crack tip flux integrals and their associated domain representations is laid out in this paper. Using a general balance statement as the starting point, crack tip integrals and complementary integrals which are valid for general material response and arbitrary crack tip motion are obtained. Our derivation emphasizes the viewpoint that crack tip integrals are direct consequences of momentum balance. Invoking appropriate restrictions on material response and crack tip motion leads directly to integrals which are in use in crack analysis. Additional crack tip integrals which are direct consequences of total energy and momentum balance are obtained in a similar manner. Some results on dual (or complementary) integrals are discussed. The study provides a framework for the derivation of crack tip integrals and allows them to be viewed from a common perspective. In fact, it will be easy to recognize that every crack tip integral under discussion can be obtained immediately from the general result by appropriately identifying the terms in the general flux tensor. The evaluation of crack tip contour integrals in numerical studies is a potential source of inaccuracy. With the help of weighting functions these integrals are recast into finite domain integrals. The latter integrals are naturally compatible with the finite element method and can be shown to be ideally suited for numerical studies of cracked bodies and the accurate calculation of pointwise energy release rates along a curvilinear three-dimensional crack front. The value of the domain integral does not depend on domain size and shape - this property provides an independent check on the consistency and quality of the numerical calculation. The success of the J-based fracture mechanics approach has led to much literature on pathindependent integrals. It will be shown that various so-called path-independent integrals (including path and area integrals) are but alternate forms of the general result referred to above and do not provide any additional information which is not already contained in the general result. Recent attempts to apply these 'newer' integrals to crack growth problems are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

A large effect of pressure is observed, with the rate of growth decreasing by approaching three orders of magnitude per kbar. It appears that the effect is mainly associated with the change in glass transition temperature although other factors may also be involved, such as the tendency of the failing material at the tip to separate into filaments. Measurements of strains at the crack tip suggest that this tendency may be associated with the presence of stresses through the thickness of the material. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

@article{Moulinet2015,
abstract = {Understanding the physics of fragmentation is important in a wide range of industrial and geophysical applications. Fragmentation processes involve large strain rates and short time scales that take place during crack nucleation and propagation. Using rubber membranes, we develop an experimental analysis that enables us to track the fragmentation process in situ in both time and space. We find that bursting a highly stretched membrane yields a treelike fragmentation network that originates at a single seed crack, followed by successive crack tip-splitting events. We show that a dynamic instability drives this branching mechanism. Fragmentation occurs when the crack tip speed attains a critical velocity for which tip splitting becomes the sole available mechanism of releasing the stored elastic energy. Given the general character of the fragmentation processes, this framework should be applicable to other crack networks in brittle materials.},

In order to compare experimental results with theoretical approaches but also to improve the understanding of dynamic crack propagation in soft materials, a crucial step is the measurement and analysis of kinematic and energetic fields in the material configuration during dynamic fracture. In this way, the proposed set-up consists in a two-camera set-up in order to perform digital image correlation during both quasi-static loading and dynamic fracture of the sample. The variety of kinematic and energetic fields that can be computed is illustrated.

abstract = {Several published papers deal with the possibility of replacing a damage finite element model by a combination of cohesive zones and finite elements. The focus of the paper is to show under which conditions this change of model can be done in an energy-wise manner. The objective is to build a cohesive model based on a known damage model, without making any assumption on the shape of the cohesive law. The method is characterized, on the one hand, by the use of a well-defined thermodynamic framework for the cohesive model and, on the other hand, by the idea that the main quantity which must be maintained through the change of model is the energy dissipated by the structure. An analysis of the stability criteria enables us to determine the domains of validity of the different models. Thus, we show that it is consistent to derive the cohesive law from a given nonlocal damage model because the occurrence of a discontinuity can be viewed as an alternative way to limit localization. The method is illustrated on one-dimensional examples and a numerical resolution method for the problem with a cohesive zone is presented. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a computational framework for dynamic crack propagation in rubber in which a nonlinear finite element analysis using cohesive zone modeling approach is used. A suddenly initiated crack at the center of biaxially stretched sheet problem is studied under plane stress conditions. A transient dynamic analysis using implicit time integration scheme is performed. In the constitutive modeling, the continuum is characterized by finite-viscoelasticity theory and coupled with the fracture processes using a cohesive zone model. This computational framework was introduced previously by the present authors (Elmukashfi and Kroon, 2012). In the current work, the use of a rate-dependent cohesive model is examined in addition to investigation of generalized biaxial loading cases. A Kelvin–Voigt element is used to describe the rate-dependent cohesive model wherein the spring is described by a bilinear law and dashpot with a constant viscosity is adopted. An explicit integration is used to incorporate the rate-dependent cohesive model in the finite element environment. A parametric study over the cohesive viscosity is performed and the steady crack propagation velocity is evaluated and compared with experimental data. It appears that the viscosity varies with the crack speed. Further, the total work of fracture is estimated using rate-independent cohesive law such that the strength of the cohesive zone is assumed to be constant and the separation work per unit area is determined form the experimental data. The results show that fracture-related processes, i.e. creation of new surfaces, cavitation and crystallization; contribute to the total work of fracture in a contradictory manner.},

The continuum is characterized by a material constitutive law that relates stress and strain, and by a relation between the tractions and displacement jumps across a specified set of cohesive surfaces. The material constitutive relation is that of an isotropic hyperelastic solid. The cohesive surface constitutive relation allows for the creation of new free surface and dimensional considerations introduce a characteristic length into the formulation. Full transient analyses are carried out. Crack branching emerges as a natural outcome of the initial-boundary value problem solution, without any ad hoc assumption regarding branching criteria. Coarse mesh calculations are used to explore various qualitative features such as the effect of impact velocity on crack branching, and the effect of an inhomogeneity in strength, as in crack growth along or up to an interface. The effect of cohesive surface orientation on crack path is also explored, and for a range of orientations zigzag crack growth precedes crack branching. Finer mesh calculations are carried out where crack growth is confined to the initial crack plane. The crack accelerates and then grows at a constant speed that, for high impact velocities, can exceed the Rayleigh wave speed. This is due to the finite strength of the cohesive surfaces. A fine mesh calculation is also carried out where the path of crack growth is not constrained. The crack speed reaches about 45{\%} of the Rayleigh wave speed, then the crack speed begins to oscillate and crack branching at an angle of about 29° from the initial crack plane occurs. The numerical results are at least qualitatively in accord with a wide variety of experimental observations on fast crack growth in brittle solids. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

The dependence of steady-state crack velocity (V) on input tearing energy exhibits a crossover at V ≈ Cs between the subsonic (V {\textless} Cs) and supershear cracks (V {\textgreater} Cs). Several features of the crack-tip strain field such as strain-magnitude, extent boundary, and singularity exponent also change substantially accompanying the transition from subsonic to supershear cracks. The definite crossover of these characteristics at V ≈ Cs reflects the variations in the crack-growth mechanism: The inertia effect comes into play in the supershear crack. We also demonstrate that the azimuthal distribution of the local crack-tip strain has a close correlation with the macroscopic crack-tip shape, regardless of the regime of V.},

The analysis is based on the fully nonlinear equilibrium theory of incompressible hyperelastic solids. We show that the dominant singularity of the near tip stress field is governed by the asymptotic solution of a linear second order ordinary differential equation. Our method is applicable to any hyperelastic material with a smooth work function that depends only on the trace of the CauchyGreen tensor and is particularly useful for materials that exhibit severe strain hardening. We apply this method to study two types of soft materials: generalized neo-Hookean solids and a solid that hardens exponentially. For the generalized neo-Hookean solids, our method is able to resolve a difficulty in the previous work by Geubelle and Knauss (1994a).

abstract = {Elastomers and soft biological tissues can undergo large deformations and exhibit time dependent behavior that is characteristic of nonlinear viscoelastic solids. This article is intended to provide an overview of the subject of nonlinear viscoelastic solids for researchers who are interested in studying the mechanics of these materials. The article begins with a review of topics from linear viscoelasticity that are pertinent to the understanding of nonlinear viscoelastic behavior. It then discusses the topics that enter into the formulation of constitutive equations for isotropic, transversely isotropic and orthotropic nonlinear viscoelastic solids. A number of specific forms of constitutive equations have been proposed in the literature and these are discussed. Attention is restricted to constitutive equations that are phenomenological rather than molecular in origin. The emphasis is then on nonlinear single integral finite linear viscoelastic and Pipkin-Rogers constitutive equations, the latter containing the quasi-linear viscoelastic model used in biomechanics of soft tissue. Expressions for the Pipkin-Rogers model are provided for isotropy, transverse isotropy and orthotropy. The constitutive equations are thenapplied to the description of homogeneous triaxial stretch and simple shear histories. The special case of uniaxial stretch histories is analyzed in detail. There is a discussion of the deviation from linear behavior as nonlinear effects become important. Non-homogeneous deformations are considered next. The combined tension and torsion of a solid cylinder on an incompressible, isotropic nonlinear viscoelastic solid is discussed in detail because of its importance in experiments involving viscoelastic materials. A large number of solutions to boundary value problems have appeared in the literature and many of these are summarized. The article concludes with comments about interesting topics for further research. {\textcopyright} 2009 SAGE Publications.},

abstract = {This contribution presents a mesh adaptive crack propagation scheme for the evaluation of the viscoelas- tic fracture response of elastomers at large strains and up to high loading rates. The approach accounts for micromechanical based features of both elastic and viscoelastic bulk responses of idealized polymer net- works. To this end, the Bergst{\"{o}}rm–Boyce model is considered to introduce hyperelastic and nonlinear finite viscoelastic responses. Moreover, the crack driving force and the crack driving direction are predicted by the material force approach. A consistent thermodynamic framework for the combined configurational motion in viscoelastic continua at finite strain regime is discussed. The fracture toughness of non-strain-crystallizing elastomers shows strong rate dependency and the energy release rate versus the rate of tearing to be a fundamental material property. Therefore, in this contri- bution, a dynamic fracture criterion, which is a function of the rate of crack growth, is shown to be adequate in numerical simulations. The use of the presented method enables to study fracture behaviour of any mate- rial nonlinearity within the implicit time integration. Main feature of the proposed algorithm is restructuring the overall discrete system by duplication of crack front DOFs based on minimization of the overall energy via the Griffith criterion.},

The Kolsky bar is a widely used device to characterize high-rate behavior of materials. When a Kolsky bar is used to determine the dynamic compressive response of an extra-soft specimen, a spike-like feature often appears in the initial portion of the measured stress history. It is important to distinguish whether this spike is an experimental artifact or an intrinsic material response. In this research, we examined this phenomenon using experimental, numerical and analytical methods. The results indicate that the spike is the extra stress from specimen radial inertia during the acceleration stage of the axial deformation. Based on this understanding, remedies in both specimen geometry and loading pulse to minimize the artifact are proposed and verified, and thus capture the intrinsic dynamic behavior of the specimen material. {\textcopyright} Society for Experimental Mechanics 2007.},

abstract = {A finite element model of a plate, which contains an initial crack subjected to a rapid loading at its faces, is investigated. A cell model of the prospective process region is adopted. The cell size is assumed to represent some characteristic intrinsic material length. The size of the process region is not predetermined but depends at every time on the number of cells that have reached a state characteristic for the process region i.e. essentially instability if load control would prevail. Outside the process region the material is assumed to be linearly elastic. For low loading magnitudes the simulations show a rather long period of crack acceleration. but at higher loads this period is short or even not detectable, and a constant terminal velocity, significantly lower than the Rayleigh wave velocity, is reached. At lower loads both the energy release rate and the extension of the process region stay rather constant, but at higher loads they increase considerably with time, even though the crack tip velocity stays constant. Thus it appears that a tendency towards increased energy flow to the process region is met by increased size of this region, and thereby increased energy dissipation per unit of crack growth, rather than by increased crack edge velocity. The process region may finally occupy several cell rows, and the control of the process region by the characteristic length is thus lost. This can explain the apparent loss of the unique relation between stress intensity factor and crack edge velocity at high crack velocities. In some simulations branching was obtained.

abstract = {This work presents a generalization of recently developed continuum phase field models for brittle fracture towards fully coupled thermo-mechanical and multi-physics problems at large strains. It outlines a rigorous geometric approach to the diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a balance of regularized crack surface, governed by a crack phase field. The regularized crack surface functional is based on a crack surface density function, that describes the macroscopic crack surface in the bulk material per unit of the reference volume. The approach overcomes difficulties associated with the computational realization of sharp crack discontinuities, in particular when it comes to complex crack topologies. The formulation proposed is essentially a gradient damage theory, however, equipped with critical ingredients rooted in fracture mechanics. A modular concept is outlined for the linking of the diffusive crack modeling with complex multi-field response of the bulk material, where focus is put on the model problem of finite thermo-elasticity. This concerns a generalization of crack driving forces from the energetic definitions towards stress-based criteria, the constitutive modeling of heat conduction across cracks and convective heat exchanges at crack faces based on additional constitutive functions. This is achieved by approximating surface load integrals of the sharp crack approach by distinct volume integrals. We demonstrate the performance of the phase field formulation of fracture at large strains by means of representative numerical examples.},

First, the effect of a narrow zone of disintegrating material at the crack tip on opening displacement and on a finite stress distribution ahead of the tip is examined for elastic materials. Extension to viscoelastic media is then made. Although the undamaged portion of the continuum is assumed linear, no significant restrictions are placed on the nature of the zone of failing material at the crack tip and, therefore, this material may be highly nonlinear, rate-dependent, and even discontinuous. Finally, formulation of the problem is completed by introducing a local energy criterion of failure at the tip which is applicable to both constant and transient tip velocities.

Eighteen three-point-bend tests were conducted using either a servo-hydraulic machine or a self-designed drop-weight impact device. Four strain gauges mounted along the ligament of the specimen were used to measure the crack velocity. Six different loading rates were applied, from 10-4 mm/s to 103 mm/s (average strain rate from 10-6 to 10-1 s-1), i.e., a low loading-rate range (5.50 × 10-4 mm/s, 0.55 mm/s and 17.4 mm/s) and a high loading-rate range (8.81 × 102 mm/s, 1.76 × 103 mm/s and 2.64 × 103 mm/s). At low loading rates, the crack propagates with increasing velocity. Under high loading rates, the crack propagates with slightly decreasing velocity, though the maximum crack speed reached up to 20.6{\%} of the Rayleigh wave speed of the tested HSC. In addition, the loading-rate effect on crack velocities is pronounced within the low loading-rate regime, whereas it is minor under the high loading-rate range. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The phase-field approach is a promising technique for the realistic simulation of brittle fracture processes, both in quasi-static and transient analysis. Considering fast loading, experimental evidence indicates a strong relationship between the rate of strain and the material's resistance against fracture, which can be considered by a dynamic increase factor for the strength of the material. The paper at hand presents a novel approach within the framework of phase-field models for brittle fracture. A rate-dependent fracture toughness is formulated as a function of the rate of crack driving strain components, which results in higher strength for faster loading. Beside the increased amount of energy necessary to evolve a crack at a high strain rate loading situation, the model incorporates quasi-viscous stress-type quantities that are not directly related to the formation of the crack and exist only in the phase-field transition zone between broken and sound material. The governing strong form equations for a transient simulation are derived and the relevant information for an implementation of the model into a finite element code is outlined in detail. The performance of the model is demonstrated for static and dynamic benchmark simulations and for a comparison to experimental findings.},

abstract = {We present a numerical formulation for three-dimensional elastodynamic problems of fracture on planar cracks and faults. Stress and displacement components are given a spectral representation as finite Fourier series in space coordinates parallel to the fracture plane. The formulation is based on an exact representation, involving a convolution integral for each Fourier mode, of the elastodynamic relation existing between the time-dependent Fourier coefficients for the tractions acting on the fracture plane and for the resulting displacement discontinuities. A wide range of constitutive models can be used to relate the local value of the strength on the fracture plane with the displacement and velocity history. Efficiency of the code is achieved by using an explicit time integration scheme and by computing the conversion between the spatial and spectral distributions through a FFT algorithm. The method is particularly suited to implementation on massively parallel computers; a CM-5 was used in this work. The stability and precision of the formulation are discussed for tensile (mode 1) situations in a detailed modal analysis, and numerical results are compared with existing three-dimensional elastodynamic solutions. The adequacy of the method to investigate various three-dimensional dynamic fracture problems involving non-propagating and propagating tensile cracks is illustrated, including crack growth along a plane of heterogeneous fracture toughness. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Dynamic crack growth in a plane strain strip is analysed using a cohesive surface fracture framework where the continuum is characterized by two constitutive relations: a material constitutive law that relates stress and strain, and a relation between the tractions and displacement jumps across a specified set of cohesive surfaces. The material constitutive relation is that of an isotropic hyperelastic solid. The cohesive surface constitutive relation introduces a characteristic length into the formulation. The resistance to crack initiation and the crack speed history are predicted without invoking any additional failure criterion. Finite-strain transient analyses are carried out, with a focus on the relation between the increase in fracture energy with crack speed and the increase in surface area due to crack branching. The numerical results show that, even with a fixed work of separation per unit area, there is a substantial increase in fracture energy with increasing crack speed. This arises from an increase in fracture surface area due to crack branching. The computational results are in good agreement with experimental observations in Sharon et al (1996).},

Heterodyne laser interferometers enable continuous, high bandwidth measurements of fault-normal (FN) and fault-parallel (FP) particle velocity "ground motion" records at discrete locations on the surface of a Homalite test specimen as a sub-Rayleigh or a supershear rupture sweeps along the frictional fault. Photoelastic interference fringes, acquired using high-speed digital photography, provide a synchronized, spatially resolved, whole field view of the advancing rupture tip and surrounding maximum shear stress field. Experimental results confirm that near field ground motion records associated with the passage of a sub-Rayleigh rupture are characterized by a FN velocity swing which dominates over the FP velocity swing. The situation is shown to reverse in the supershear rupture speed regime whereby the motion along the shear Mach front is characterized by a FP particle velocity swing which dominates over the FN velocity swing. Additional distinguishing particle velocity signatures, consistent with theoretical and numerical predictions, and repeatedly observed in experimental records are (1) a pronounced peak in the FP velocity record, induced by the leading dilatational field, which sweeps the measurement station just prior to the arrival of the shear Mach front, and (2) a pronounced velocity swing in the FN record associated with the arrival of a "trailing Rayleigh disturbance", which sweeps the measurement station following passage of the shear Mach front. Each of these features are addressed in detail. We conclude by reexamining the 2002, Mw7.9 Denali fault earthquake and the remarkable set of ground motion records obtained at Pump Station 10 (PS10), located approximately 85km east of the epicenter and 3km north of the fault along the Alaska Pipeline. Motivated by the analysis and thorough interpretation of these records by Dunham and Archuleta (2004, 2005), we attempt to replicate the Denali ground motion signatures using a laboratory earthquake experiment. The experiments feature a left (west) to right (east) propagating right lateral rupture within the Homalite test specimen with particle velocity data collected at a near-field station situated just above (north of) the fault, (on the compressional quadrant) in order to simulate the PS10 scenario. Both sub-Rayleigh and supershear laboratory earthquake experiments are conducted using the "Denali PS10" configuration in order to compare and contrast the resulting particle velocity signatures. Results from the supershear experiment capture the prominent FN and FP ground motion signatures and corresponding sense of particle motion revealed in the PS10 ground motion records. Most notably, the particle velocity records feature a dominant FP component coinciding with the arrival of the shear Mach front, followed by a pronounced velocity swing in the FN component coinciding with the passage of a trailing Rayleigh disturbance, as independently confirmed by the presence of these features and their noted arrival times in the synchronized photoelastic image sequence. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper discusses a new continuum formulation for viscoelastic materials at finite strains. The model proposed is based on the multiplicative decomposition of the isochoric component of deformation gradient into elastic and viscous contribution and the generalized Maxwell rheological model. The inelastic or viscous components of the deformation gradient provide the internal variables required for the irreversible thermo-mechanical model. Nonlinear rate type of evolution equations are then proposed for the internal variables. These are based on a particular linear relaxation form of the generalized Maxwell model which leads to a viscoelastic formulation that can be seen as a particular case of a large strain viscoplastic model based on maximum plastic dissipation. In addition to the rate evolution equations, simple incremental stress update equations are proposed. These closely resemble the radial return algorithms used in von Mises plasticity. Finally a spatial form of the viscoelastic formulation is presented for isotropic materials. This formulation is based on principal directions and logarithmic stretches. Again incremental equations will be considered in order to permit subsequent computational implementations. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Classical fracture mechanics applied to a viscoelastic material states that the critical stress-intensity factor at which the crack propagates depends on the instantaneous elastic modulus of the solid, and provides no mechanism for a speed dependence of the apparent surface energy. This suggests that any speed dependence must be because surface energy itself is speed-dependant. Schapery (1975) has explained how by using the Barenblatt concept of fracture mechanics, involving surface forces instead of surface energy alone, a dependence of the apparent surface energy on the crack speed is found. Here, Schapery's principles are applied to the particular case of a Maugis–Dugdale surface force law and a three-element viscoelastic solid to find the complete dependence of the apparent surface energy, both in fracture and in crack healing, on the crack velocity. To a good approximation, the apparent surface energy in crack healing is the reciprocal of the energy for fracture. Simple approximate equations relating the crack speed to the stress-intensity factor are given.},

abstract = {A continuous damage theory is presented for the quasi-static and dynamic behavior of brittle materials. The fact that the strain-rate effects observed can be mainly attributed to the rate-sensitivity of the microcracking process makes the damage concept particularly attractive. Considering flat microcracks a vectorial representation is adopted for the damage variable. A free energy function dependent on the coupled invariants of strain and damage is postulated, and the constitutive equations and the damage evolution equations are derived consistently subject to thermodynamic restrictions. The stress-strain curves for uniaxial tension and compression resulting from the theory are compared with available experimental results for concrete. A decrease in the nonlinearity of the stress-strain curves is observed as the strain-rate is increased. A higher strain-rate sensitivity in tension, as compared to compression, is also predicted. Further results on uniaxial tension illustrate how pre-existing damage influences the nonlinearity of the stress-strain curves and results in a rotation of the damage vector. {\textcopyright} ASCE.},

abstract = {The tendancy of a crack to extend under applied loads is governed by the cohesive forces acting near the crack tip. The crack-extension criteria of Griffith and Barenblatt take account of the cohesive forces in rather different ways, but are both of the same form. Therefore, if they are to agree, the surface energy T appearing in the Griffith criterion must be related in a definite way to Barenblatt's modulus of cohesion K. It is shown in this paper, from a detailed consideration of the cohesive forces, that the required relationship holds, in an asymptotic sense, if the forces act only over a short range; this is true in practice. Extension of the analysis to uniformly moving cracks then shows that K is a function of velocity, even for a perfectly elastic-brittle body. This has not been noted previously. Finally, the relative advantages of the two formulations are compared.},

The three-dimensional material law is applicable to the thermomechanical characterization of elastomeric (high-polymeric) solids in the finite strain domain under varying temperature. The description is based on the concept of internal state variables and rational thermodynamics. The main goal of the presentation is to develop consistent constitutive equations for the stress, entropy and independent internal variables such that the second law of thermodynamics, in the form of the Clausius-Duhem inequality, is satisfied. Motivated by the significant difference in bulk and shear response of elastomers, the model employs a local decomposition of the deformation into a dilatational and an isochoric part. The framework of nonlinear thermoviscoelasticity presented herein is formulated entirely in the reference configuration and provides a sound continuum basis for approximation techniques such as the Finite-Element method.

Their capabilities are demonstrated in three case studies of interfacial failure. The first is a simulation of the t-peel test for the determination of adhesion between two elastomers. This case is characterized by large, inelastic deformation that is difficult to model using classical fracture mechanics and analytic cohesive zone approaches. The formulation allows simulation of crack growth in the presence of large global strains and the identification of peak viscous loss zones in the peel arms. The second case study is the analysis of a compressive shear test to determine adhesion between a viscoelastic elastomer and a rigid substrate. An experimentally observed transition from stable to unstable fracture is described accurately by the model, providing appropriate cohesive zone parameters are established. The third example treats interfacial failure in a multilayer elasto-plastic polymer system. The approach illustrates a capability to capture crack nucleation and propagation in systems with complex microstructures comprising of multiple layered phases and associated interfaces.},

To achieve this main objective, we first rigorously reformulate two-dimensional linear elastic dynamic fracture problems using variational methods and shape derivative techniques. The classical equation of motion governing a smoothly propagating crack tip follows by considering variations of a space-time action integral. We then give a variationally consistent framework of the dynamic gradient damage model. Owing to the analogies between the variational ingredients of these two models and under some basic assumptions concerning the damage band structuration, one obtains a generalized Griffith criterion which governs the crack tip evolution within the non-local damage model. Assuming further that the internal length is small compared to the dimension of the body, the previous criterion leads to the classical Griffith's law through a separation of scales between the outer linear elastic domain and the inner damage process zone.},

The present study is intended to further the understanding of the dissipative processes that take place in rubber in the vicinity of a propagating crack tip. This dissipation contributes significantly to the total fracture toughness of the rubber and is therefore of great interest from a fracture mechanics point of view. To study this, a computational framework for analysing high-speed crack growth in a biaxially stretched rubber under plane stress is therefore formulated. The main purpose is to investigate the energy release rates required for crack propagation under different modes of biaxial stretching. The results show, that inertia comes into play when the crack speed exceeds about 50 m/s. The total work of fracture by far exceeds the surface energy consumed at the very crack tip, and the difference must be attributed to dissipative damage processes in the vicinity of the crack tip. The size of this damage/dissipation zone is expected to be a few millimetres.},

Experiments on dynamic fracture in brittle amorphous materials have produced results' that agree with theoretical predictions for single-crack motion at very low velocities. But numerous apparent discrepancies with theory have been observed(2-4) at higher velocities. In particular, the maximum crack velocities attained in amorphous materials are far slower than the predicted asymptotic value, v(R) (ref. 3). Beyond a critical velocity, v(c) approximate to 0.4v(R), an intrinsic instability has been observed(5) in which a multiple-crack state is formed by repetitive, frustrated micro-branching events. These cause velocity oscillations and may explain the apparent anomaly. Here we report measurements of dynamic fracture in a brittle, amorphous material that are in quantitative agreement with the theoretical single-crack equation of motion, from the initial stages of propagation up to v(c). Beyond v(c), agreement breaks down owing to the appearance of the multiple-crack ensemble. But in this regime, the micro-branching process can momentarily produce a single-crack state which instantaneously attains its predicted single-crack velocity, for velocities up to 0.9v(R). Our results therefore confirm the validity of the single-crack continuum theory of elastic brittle fracture even in the dynamical regime where the crack morphology is complex.},

abstract = {The unstable growth of a crack in a large viscoelastic plate is considered within the framework of continuum mechanics. Starting from the local stress and deformation fields at the tip of the crack, a non-linear, first order differential equation is found to describe the time history of the crack size if the stress applied far from the crack is constant. The differential equation contains the creep compliance and the intrinsic surface energy of the material. The surface energy concept for viscoelastic materials is clarified. Inertial effects are not considered, but the influence of temperature is included for thermorheologically simple materials. Initial crack velocities are given as a function of applied load in closed form, as well as a comparison of calculated crack growth history with experiments. Above a certain high stress, crack propagation ensues at high speeds controlled by material inertia while at a lower limit infinite time is required to produce crack growth. Thus an upper and lower limit criterion of the Griffith type exists. For rate insensitive (elastic) materials the two limits coalesce and only the brittle fracture criterion of Griffith exists. The implications of these results for creep fracture in metals and inorganic glasses are examined.},

@article{Petrov2004,
abstract = {Experiments on the dynamic fracture of solids, liquids , conductors, and insulators that is caused by fast intense actions of environment or directed energy fluxes reveal a number of effects indicating a fundamental difference between the fast dynamic rupture (breakdown) of materials and a similar process under slow quasistatic actions. For example, one of the basic problems in testing the dynamic-strength properties of materials is associated with the dependence of the limiting characteristics on the duration, amplitude, and growth rate of an external action, as well as on a number of other factors. Whereas a critical value is a constant for a material in the static case, experimentally determined critical characteristics in dynamics are strongly unstable, and as a result, their behavior becomes unpredictable. The indicated (and some other) features of the behavior of materials subjected to pulsed actions are common for a number of seemingly quite different physical processes, such as dynamic fracture (starting cracks and splitting), cavitation in liquids, and electrical breakdown in solids. In this paper, we analyze examples illustrating typical dynamic effects inherent in the these processes. We propose a unified interpretation for the fracture of solids and liquids and electrical breakdown in insulators using the structural-time approach [1, 2] based on the concept of the fracture incubation time. CRITERION OF THE FRACTURE INCUBATION TIME The basic cause of difficulties in modeling the afore-mentioned effects of mechanical or electrical strength is the absence of an adequate limiting condition that determines the instant of rupture or breakdown. This problem can be solved by using both the structural mac-romechanics of fracture and the concept of the fracture incubation time, which represents the kinetic processes of the formation of macroscopic breaks [1, 2]. The above effects become essential for actions whose periods are comparable with the scale determined by the fracture incubation time associated with preparatory relaxation processes of developing microdefects in the material structure. The criterion of the fracture incubation time proposed in [1, 2] makes it possible to calculate effects of the unstable behavior of dynamic-strength characteristics. These effects are observed in experiments on the fracture of solids. This criterion can be generalized in the form of the condition (1) Here, F (t) is the intensity of a local force field causing the fracture of the medium, F s is the static limit of the local force field, and $\tau$ is the incubation time associated with the dynamics of a relaxation process preparing the break. The fracture time is defined as the time at which condition (1) becomes an equality. The parameter $\alpha$ characterizes the sensitivity of a material to the intensity of the force field causing fracture. By example of the mechanical break of a material, we now consider one of the possible methods of interpreting and determining the parameter $\tau$. We assume that a standard sample made of a given material under tension is broken into two parts under the stress P arising at a certain time t = 0: F (t) = PH (t) , where H (t) is the Heaviside step function. In the case of quasi-brittle fracture, the material is unloaded, and the local stress at the break point decreases rapidly (but not instantaneously) from P to 0. In this case, the corresponding unloading wave is generated, propagates over the sample , and can be detected by well-known (e.g., interfero-metric) methods. The stress variation at the break point can be conditionally represented by the dependence $\sigma$ (t) = P-Pf (t) , where the function f (t) varies from 0 to 1 within a certain time interval T. The case f (t) = H (t) corresponds to the classical theory of strength. In other 1 $\tau$-F t' () F s-    $\alpha$ t' 1. ≤ d t $\tau$-t ∫},

One key ingredient is the introduction of a fixed (absolute) configuration, relative to which both physical and (virtual) configurational and spatial changes can be described. Only quasistatic and isothermal conditions are considered in this paper. A variational framework is established for the rate of global energy dissipation (integrated over the whole material domain) due to the combined action of a (discrete) crack extension and continuum inelasticity, whereby the material time derivative of internal variables and the rate of crack extension are coupled. The classical assumption (previously adopted in the literature) is that there is no coupling, i.e. the internal variables are considered as fixed (material) fields just like an inhomogeneous material property. The other (extreme) assumption is that the internal variables fields are convected with the configurational motion due to the virtual crack extension. Both cases are investigated in this paper for a simple 2D example of an edge crack in a plate in a setting of small strains and hardening plasticity. In particular, we consider convergence issues from mesh refinement.},

This minimum principle can be taken as a basis for asymptotic error estimation. In particular, we chose to monitor the error of a lower-order projection of the finite element solution. The optimal mesh size distribution then follows from a posteriori error indicators which are purely local, i.e. can be computed element-by-element.

abstract = {The last decade has seen a growing interest in cohesive zone models for fatigue applications. These cohesive zone models often suffer from a lack of generality and applying them typically requires calibrating a large number of model-specific parameters. To improve on these issues a new method has been proposed in this paper based on the Thick Level Set approach. In this concept, material degradation due to cyclic loading is the result of interaction between damage evolution and fracture mechanics. The Thick Level Set formulation has been extended to interface elements, in order to allow for separation of strain energy in the bulk and energy required for surface creation. Global fracture parameters, derived from a free energy description governing the interface elements, are used as input for the empirical crack growth rate relation (Paris' equation). It must be emphasized that in contrast to existing fatigue models, the Thick Level Set approach does not require the definition of a damage evolution law. Instead, damage is updated automatically by a continuously moving damage front. It is shown that applicability is not limited to fatigue behavior of linear elastic materials; elastic-plastic materials such as steels can be analysed as well. The sensitivity of model parameters is investigated and discussed and the practical relevance is explored for standard test configurations.},

The cohesive element governs the separation of the crack flanks in accordance with an irreversible cohesive law, eventually leading to the formation of free surfaces, and is compatible with a conventional finite element discretization of the bulk material. The versatility and predictive ability of the method is demonstrated through the simulation of a drop-weight dynamic fracture test similar to those reported by Zehnder and Rosakis.1 The ability of the method to approximate the experimentally observed crack-tip trajectory is particularly noteworthy.

abstract = {Crack growth rates (r) were measured in pure shear test specimens as a function of strain energy release rate (G) for a non-crystallizing SBR elastomer. Measurements were made as a function of: extent of swelling with Dibutyl Adipate; carbon black content; and crosslink density. In some cases experiments were carried out over a range of temperatures. In most cases the resulting G versus r plots showed a clear transition from rough to smooth crack surface behaviour with increasing crack growth rate, with an intervening slip/stick region. In the high speed/steady tear/smooth region the value of G necessary to drive a crack at a given rate was determined largely by the magnitude of the visco-elastic losses in the crack tip region, increasing with: decreasing temperature; increasing molar mass between crosslinks; decreasing extent of swelling; and increasing carbon black content. However G was independent of specimen thickness in this region suggesting that crack tip effects were minimal. In the low speed/rough region changes in the magnitude of G with materials and temperature/rate variables could not be explained by changes in visco-elastic loss alone. Furthermore the magnitude of G increased significantly with increasing specimen thickness. This suggested that in this region cavitation ahead of the growing crack tip resulting from dilatational stresses determined the crack tip diameter, and hence the magnitude of G. {\textcopyright} 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {Several strip band fracture tests have been performed with rubber toughened polymethylmethacrylate (RT-PMMA) samples. Using different types of profilometer, the precise amounts of created surfaces for different locations along the fracture were measured both before and after branching at different scales. It was observed that the fluctuations of the dynamic fracture energy that could be of the order of 300{\%}, are well explained by the fluctuations of the actual amount of created surface when the fracture roughness is sampled at a scale of the order of 0.1. $\mu$m. This study shows that the classic approach, which approximates the amount of created surface during propagation as a flat rectangle defined as the sample thickness multiplied by the crack length, is not appropriate for a convenient estimate of fracture energy. Indeed, it is shown that the real 3D topography of the created surface has to be included in the energy balance to quantify an intrinsic material fracture energy. If not, fracture energy can be significantly underestimated. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

As a sequel to our investigation on the anti-plane shear case (Yu and Yang, 1994), the present paper focuses on the in-plane transonic debonding case. We present complete solutions under conditions of both plane strain and plane stress for an interfacial crack advancing within various velocity regimes below the longitudinal wave speed of the stiffer material component. The stress singularities and the angular stress distributions in different transonic regimes are determined in closed form. The coefficients representing stress intensities are deter mined explicitly for the case of point forces acting on the crack faces and translating with the crack tip. The boundedness of energy flow across the interface precludes debonding beyond the higher Rayleigh wave speed. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

@article{Leblond2018,
abstract = {In a previous paper (Leblond et al., 2011), we proposed a theoretical interpretation of the experimentally well known instability of coplanar crack propagation in mode I+III. The interpretation relied on a stability analysis based on analytical expressions of the stress intensity factors for a crack slightly perturbed both within and out of its original plane, due to Gao and Rice (1986) and Movchan et al. (1998), coupled with a double propagation criterion combining Griffith's energetic condition and principle of local symmetry. Under such assumptions instability modes were indeed evidenced for values of the mode mixity ratio of the mode III to mode I stress intensity factors applied remotely larger than some threshold depending only on Poisson's ratio. Unfortunately, the predicted thresholds were much larger than those generally observed for typical values of this material parameter. While the subcritical character of the nonlinear bifurcation from coplanar to fragmented fronts has been proposed as a possible explanation for this discrepancy (Chen et al., 2015), we propose here an alternative explanation based on the introduction of a constitutive relationship between the fracture energy and the mode mixity ratio, which is motivated by experimental observations. By reexamining the linear stability analysis of a planar propagating front, we show that such a relationship suffices, provided that it is strong enough, to lower significantly the threshold value of the mode mixity ratio for instability so as to bring it in a range more consistent with experiments. Interesting formulae are also derived for the distributions of the perturbed stress intensity factors and energy release rate, in the special case of perturbations of the crack surface and front obeying the principle of local symmetry and having reached a stationary state.},

abstract = {In the present paper, dynamic crack propagation in rubber is analyzed numerically using the finite element method. The problem of a suddenly initiated crack at the center of stretched sheet is studied under plane stress conditions. A nonlinear finite element analysis using implicit time integration scheme is used. The bulk material behavior is described by finite-viscoelasticity theory and the fracture separation process is characterized using a cohesive zone model with a bilinear traction-separation law. Hence, the numerical model is able to model and predict the different contributions to the fracture toughness, i.e. the surface energy, viscoelastic dissipation, and inertia effects. The separation work per unit area and the strength of the cohesive zone have been parameterized, and their influence on the separation process has been investigated. A steadily propagating crack is obtained and the corresponding crack tip position and velocity history as well as the steady crack propagation velocity are evaluated and compared with experimental data. A minimum threshold stretch of 3.0 is required for crack propagation. The numerical model is able to predict the dynamic crack growth. It appears that the strength and the surface energy vary with the crack speed. Finally, the maximum principal stretch and stress distribution around steadily propagation crack tip suggest that crystallization and cavity formation may take place.},

abstract = {This paper develops a continuum theory for the elastic-viscoplastic deformation of amorphous solids such as polymeric and metallic glasses. Introducing an internal-state variable that represents the local free-volume associated with certain metastable states, we are able to capture the highly non-linear stress-strain behavior that precedes the yield-peak and gives rise to post-yield strain softening. Our theory explicitly accounts for the dependence of the Helmholtz free energy on the plastic deformation in a thermodynamically consistent manner. This dependence leads directly to a backstress in the underlying flow rule, and allows us to model the rapid strain-hardening response after the initial yield-drop in monotonic deformations, as well as the Bauschinger-type reverse-yielding phenomena typically observed in amorphous polymeric solids upon unloading after large plastic deformations. We have implemented a special set of constitutive equations resulting from the general theory in a finite-element computer program. Using this finite-element program, we apply the specialized equations to model the large-deformation response of the amorphous polymeric solid polycarbonate, at ambient temperature and pressure. We show numerical results to some representative problems, and compare them against corresponding results from physical experiments. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A fundamental solution is derived for particular loading on the body which makes it possible to obtain the solution for the complete dynamic stress field due to crack extension by linear superposition. The details of the solution are worked out for the dynamic stress intensity factor for the moving crack. It is found that the stress intensity factor varies almost linearly with the crack speed, from the static value at zero speed to zero at the Rayleigh wave speed. Some numerical results are also presented for the shape of the crack tip as a function of crack speed.

@article{Ortiz1999,
abstract = {We present a class of constitutive updates for general viscoplastic solids including such aspects of material behavior as finite elastic and plastic deformations, non-Newtonian viscosity, rate-sensitivity and arbitrary flow and hardening rules. The distinguishing characteristic of the proposed constitutive updates is that, by construction, the corresponding incremental stress-strain relations derive from a pseudo-elastic strain-energy density. This, in turn, confers the incremental boundary value problem a variational structure. In particular, the incremental deformation mapping follows from a minimum principle. This minimum principle may conveniently be taken as a basis for error estimation and mesh adaption. The accuracy and robustness of the variational constitutive updates is demonstrated with the aid of convergence tests involving the finitely-deforming Mises solid and ductile single crystals. The ability of the updates to resolve the complex patterns of slip activity which arise in the latter application is particularly noteworthy. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

abstract = {We discuss the connection between two important parallel developments in continuum mechanics that has gone unnoticed despite intense activity in both these seemingly disparate areas: the first stems from the pioneering work of Eckart on the role of the evolution of "natural configurations" in the inelastic response of solids; the second stems from the seminal work of Eshelby concerning the energy-momentum tensor associated with the driving forces that arise as a consequence of inhomogeneities and defects during the deformations of solids. We show that a variety of driving forces manifest themselves as a consequence of the evolution of natural configurations, depending on the particular process under consideration. Our study makes it clear that no new balance laws need be invoked in order to accommodate such driving forces, the usual balances laws of mechanics being sufficient. {\textcopyright} 2005 Sage Publications.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate current simulation capabilities for thin film delamination on the basis of real test data as well as a contribution to its extension in order to partly substitute experimental investigations. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed model consists of a formulation that describes the behaviour of the bulk material and an approach that introduces the film's delamination capability. An implicit finite element framework with a cohesive zone implementation is used and described in detail. The numerical results on the basis of the a priori identified material parameters are related to the experimental work. In order to capture the obvious peel speed dependency of these delamination processes, a viscoelastic cohesive formulation is introduced and compared with a pure separation rate dependent cohesive material in the second part of this contribution. Findings - The performed numerical simulations show a good approximation of the experimental peel process. The extension in order to take time-dependent effects into account is required for the simulation of such problems. In contrast with the pure rate-dependent model, the presented consistent formulation of the cohesive part is able to cover the whole range of observed material phenomena. Research limitations/implications - Owing to the absence of suitable experimental single mode investigations of the sealed layer, the used cohesive material parameters are identified in relation to the pre-existing experimental results. Furthermore, the resultant peel force has a constant value due to the assumed homogeneous cohesive material and therefore gives only a mean approximation of the experimental values at this stage of the investigation. Originality/value - The numerical representation of such a thin film delamination process in relation to real experimental results shows the additional capabilities and the usability of the implicit finite element method with a cohesive zone implementation in a clear and illustrative way. The first proposed cohesive extension based on a rheological model shows the capability to cover the full range of time-dependent interface layer behaviour. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

@article{Ozenc2014,
abstract = {This paper discusses the role of the material or rather configurational force approach in elastic–plastic materials with a pre-cracked configuration and gives an overview of some recent numerical investigations of the crack tip field. On the theoretical side, a consistent thermodynamic framework for the combined configurational and deformational motion in elasto-plastic continua at small and finite strains is discussed. Furthermore, the study researches the separation of the total dissipation in terms of the change in elastic energy and in terms of the material dissipation by a configurational change obtained from the global energy momentum balance. On the numerical side, an equivalent general expression of the vectorial material forces is derived from the weak form of the energy momentum balance. For the sake of simplicity, all results are obtained neglecting dynamic and thermo-mechanical phenomena. The computations are applied to a stationary crack in a circular pre-cracked domain and a compact tension specimen under plasticity condition. The results show that the material force approach remains path independent only if all components of the momentum balance equation are properly included into the corresponding variational formulation. In addition, the cohesive fracture theory is combined with the material force approach in order to increase the clarity of the interpretation of the approach in engineering applications. Correspondingly, the results obtained from the compact tension specimen with three different free energy functions are compared to the conventional J-integral method and to experimental results available from a previous study. The contributions of this study are threefold. First, the path dependency of the material force approach in elasto-plastic continua is found to be considerably depending on the so-called material body forces. Secondly, interpretation of the induced material dissipation forces in the definition of the crack driving forces is not explicitly clear but they play an important role in case of path independency. Finally, with further analyses on compact tension examples, it is shown that the introduced energy functions in the material momentum balance yield a difference for the evaluation of the material force approach and the traditional J-integral.},

We have reformulated the CLN theory and have discovered, surprisingly, that their model is mathematically ill-posed. In an attempt to correct this difficulty and to construct models that might exhibit realistic behavior, we have extended the CLN analysis to include dissipative mechanisms within the cohesive zone. We have succeeded to some extent in finding mathematically well posed systems; and we even have found a class of models for which a transition from stability to instability may occur at a nonzero crack speed via a Hopf bifurcation at a finite wavelength of the applied perturbation. However, our general conclusion is that these cohesive-zone models are inherently unsatisfactory for use in dynamical studies. They are extremely difficult mathematically, and they seem to be highly sensitive to details that ought to be physically unimportant. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{Lake2000,
abstract = {The fracture behavior of elastomers has been studied in the high speed region immediately above a transition region where a change in the nature of the fracture surface occurs. A video camera operating at up to 6000 frames/s was used to follow the progress of failure. The test pieces employed were of the pure shear or tensile strip (with edge crack) varieties employed in earlier tear studies; in orderto attain the high energy release rates required they were usually pre-strained and then cut to initiate the crack growth. The materials studied included various strain crystallizing and non-crystallizing elastomers, with different glass-transition temperatures, including natural rubber in normal, cis-trans isomerized or partially-epoxidized forms, a butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer, a styrene-butadiene copolymer and ethylene-propylene co- and ter-polymers. The use of a fracture mechanics approach based on the strain energy release rate enables results for different test piece geometries to be brought into agreement in the region above the transition. Fracture energies in this region correlate well with viscoelastic properties, but the potential for strain crystallization to strengthen is not exhibited. This is presumably because at the high failure rates involved, the loading time at the crack tip is insufficient to allow significant crystallization to occur. The correlation with viscoelastic behavior suggests that the material around the propagating tip is still essentially rubbery in its behavior, although the fracture surfaces in the high speed region have a smooth, "glassy" appearance. Further evidence of this is provided by effects of crosslink type and density and filler type and loading, where again the effects seen in the high speed failure region parallel those observed below the transition. An effect of thickness on fracture properties appears to be absent in the high speed region, by contrast with behavior at lower energies and at the transition itself. This supports the view that the fracture surface roughness that develops in the lower energy region is due to the initiation of a process akin to cavitation by through-the-thickness stresses near the crack tip. The transition is found to vary with pressure and temperature, as well as thickness, in a way that does not correlate with viscoelastic changes but may reflect changes in the through-the-thickness stresses. The existence of a limiting crack speed is illustrated and discussed. Fracture under large biaxial deformations, where higher crack speeds are observed, will be discussed in part II.},

abstract = {The cohesive crack tip model became very popular in fracture and failure mechanics, starting with the original publications of (Dugdale, 1960) [1] and (Barenblatt, 1962) [2] and first practical applications in the early 1980s. A compact representation of the fracture mechanical basis, kinematic and constitutive issues as well as some special characteristics of the related finite element formulation are given in the first part of this contribution. The main part is dedicated to the presentation and discussion of recent developments of cohesive finite element methods for time-dependent fracture. On the basis of a rheological model assumption, a novel viscoelastic extension for cohesive traction separation laws is presented and the resultant characteristic behaviour is depicted and compared for different loading conditions. Adopting an industrial application of a peel foil specimen, the time-dependent characteristics as well as some aspects of parameter identification and application of the material model are shown.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, London, UK. Crack growth dynamics is studied experimentally and analyzed focusing on both kinetics and crack tip profiles utilizing acrylonitrile butadiene rubbers which are filled with different amounts of carbon black. The behavior of crack growth is characterized by the relation between the tearing energy and the crack growth rate, and all samples show the discontinuous transition of the crack growth rate between the ‘slow mode' and ‘fast mode' in a narrow range of the tearing energy. In the ‘fast mode' crack growth rate (about 1–100 m/sec) shows a power-law relationship with the tearing energy, while in the ‘slow mode' the crack growth rate (about 0.01–1 mm/sec) exhibits no definite dependence on the tearing energy. The high resolution measurements reveals that the features of the crack tip profile drastically change at the discontinuous transition of the crack growth rate. The crack tip profiles observed are characterized by the gap from the parabolic profile expected by Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). The weakly nonlinear elasticity theory on fracture dynamics, which considers the contribution of the second-order modulus to the strain field, successfully explains the small gaps ( {\textless}  ca. 1 mm) independently of whether the mode of interestis ‘slow' or ‘fast'. The failure of the theory becomes pronounced in the cases of the large gaps ( {\textgreater}  ca. 1 mm) in the ‘fast mode' where the specimens undergo large strain and high strain rate. These results demonstrate the significance of the nonlinear viscoelasticity in the crack growth phenomena.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the crack driving force in elastic-plastic materials, with particular emphasis on incremental plasticity. Using the configurational forces approach we identify a "plasticity influence term" that describes crack tip shielding or anti-shielding due to plastic deformation in the body. Standard constitutive models for finite strain as well as small strain incremental plasticity are used to obtain explicit expressions for the plasticity influence term in a two-dimensional setting. The total dissipation in the body is related to the near-tip and far-field J-integrals and the plasticity influence term. In the special case of deformation plasticity the plasticity influence term vanishes identically whereas for rigid plasticity and elastic-ideal plasticity the crack driving force vanishes. For steady state crack growth in incremental elastic-plastic materials, the plasticity influence term is equal to the negative of the plastic work per unit crack extension and the total dissipation in the body due to crack propagation and plastic deformation is determined by the far-field J-integral. For non-steady state crack growth, the plasticity influence term can be evaluated by post-processing after a conventional finite element stress analysis. Theory and computations are applied to a stationary crack in a C(T)-specimen to examine the effects of contained, uncontained and general yielding. A novel method is proposed for evaluating J-integrals under incremental plasticity conditions through the configurational body force. The incremental plasticity near-tip and far-field J-integrals are compared to conventional deformational plasticity and experimental J-integrals. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Highly-deformable materials, from synthetic hydrogels to biological tissues, are becoming increasingly important from both fundamental and practical perspectives. Their mechanical behaviors, in particular the dynamics of crack propagation during failure, are not yet fully understood. Here we propose a theoretical framework for the dynamic fracture of highly-deformable materials, in which the effects of a dynamic crack are treated with respect to the nonlinearly deformed (pre-stressed/strained), non-cracked, state of the material. Within this framework, we derive analytic and semi-analytic solutions for the near-tip deformation fields and energy release rates of dynamic cracks propagating in incompressible neo-Hookean solids under biaxial and uniaxial loading. We show that moderately large pre-stressing has a marked effect on the stress fields surrounding a crack's tip. We verify these predictions by performing extensive experiments on the fracture of soft brittle elastomers over a range of loading levels and propagation velocities, showing that the newly developed framework offers significantly better approximations to the measurements than standard approaches at moderately large levels of external loadings and high propagation velocities. This framework should be relevant to the failure analysis of soft and tough, yet brittle, materials.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the role of the material or rather configurational force approach in elastic-plastic materials with a pre-cracked configuration and gives an overview of some recent numerical investigations of the crack tip field. On the theoretical side, a consistent thermodynamic framework for the combined configurational and deformational motion in elasto-plastic continua at small and finite strains is discussed. Furthermore, the study researches the separation of the total dissipation in terms of the change in elastic energy and in terms of the material dissipation by a configurational change obtained from the global energy momentum balance. On the numerical side, an equivalent general expression of the vectorial material forces is derived from the weak form of the energy momentum balance. For the sake of simplicity, all results are obtained neglecting dynamic and thermo-mechanical phenomena. The computations are applied to a stationary crack in a circular pre-cracked domain and a compact tension specimen under plasticity condition. The results show that the material force approach remains path independent only if all components of the momentum balance equation are properly included into the corresponding variational formulation. In addition, the cohesive fracture theory is combined with the material force approach in order to increase the clarity of the interpretation of the approach in engineering applications. Correspondingly, the results obtained from the compact tension specimen with three different free energy functions are compared to the conventional J-integral method and to experimental results available from a previous study. The contributions of this study are threefold. First, the path dependency of the material force approach in elasto-plastic continua is found to be considerably depending on the so-called material body forces. Secondly, interpretation of the induced material dissipation forces in the definition of the crack driving forces is not explicitly clear but they play an important role in case of path independency. Finally, with further analyses on compact tension examples, it is shown that the introduced energy functions in the material momentum balance yield a difference for the evaluation of the material force approach and the traditional J-integral. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Tensile wave propagation experiments were conducted at high strain rates by holding one end fixed and displacing the other end at a constant velocity. A high-speed video camera was used to monitor the motion and to determine the evolution of strain and particle velocity in rubber strips. Analysis of the response through the theory of finite waves indicated a need for an appropriate constitutive model for rubber; by quantitative matching between the experimental observations and analytical predictions, an appropriate instantaneous elastic response for the rubbers was obtained. This matching process suggested that a simple power-law constitutive model was capable of representing the high strain-rate response for both rubbers used. {\textcopyright} 2010 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, elastomeric solids which are of essential engineering interest are discussed. In order to simulate the significant different bulk/shear-response of polymeric media the deformation is decomposed into volumetric elastic and isochoric viscoelastic parts. The constitutive equations are presented within the context of internal variable models and a Lagrangian kinematical description is adopted throughout. For sufficiently slow processes the material responds in a rubbery elastic manner which is assumed to be modelled with an Ogden-type strain energy function well-known from rubber elasticity. The stresses and the symmetric consistent tangent moduli are briefly discussed along with a second-order approximation of the constitutive rate equation. The main thrust of this paper on the computational side is to show the meaningful time-dependent behaviour and the general applicability of the three-dimensional constitutive model. By applying assumed enhanced strain elements which are wellsuited for (nearly) incompressible problems three representative numerical examples illustrate relaxation and creeping phenomena at large strains and the equilibrium finite elastic response, which is asymptotically obtained.},

abstract = {The velocity transition in crack-growth dynamics and the accompanying changes in crack tip shapes are investigated for the elastomers composed of styrene-butadiene rubber and silica filler (SBR/SI). The concentrations of filler and cross-link (ϕf and cx, respectively), and temperature (T) are extensively varied in order to change the degree of nonlinearity in elasticity of the elastomers. The shapes of the crack tip are characterized by three parameters, i.e., the deviation $\delta$ from the parabolic one expected by the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), the parabolic curvature a, and the non-dimensional quantity a$\delta$. The dependence of these parameters on the input tearing energy $\Gamma$ is successfully explained by the weakly nonlinear theory of dynamic fracture (WNLT), which considers the contribution of the second-order shear modulus $\mu$(2) to the strain field in addition to that of the first-order shear modulus $\mu$(1), independently of ϕf, cx and T, unless $\delta$ exceeds a limit value ($\delta$C). SBR/SI shows an appreciably larger value of $\delta$C than the carbon-black filled acrylonitrile butadiene (NBR/CB) elastomers. The smaller value of $\delta$C for NBR/CB is attributed to that the contribution of the third-order nonlinear modulus $\mu$(3)/$\mu$(1), which is not considered in WNLT, is appreciably higher than that in SBR/SI. The magnitude of the threshold tearing energy $\Gamma$c for the onset of the velocity transition shows a good correlation with the fracture toughness Wc normalized by the nonlinear elastic constant $\mu$(1)3/$\mu$(2)2 in WNLT. This result indicates that the magnitude is governed by the combined effect of the degree of nonlinearity in elasticity and the fracture toughness.},

@article{Nguyen2006,
abstract = {This paper presents a finite element study of cohesive crack growth in a thin infinite viscoelastic strip to investigate the effects of viscoelastic properties, strip height, and cohesive model parameters on the crack growth resistance. The results of the study show that the dependence of the fracture energy on the viscoelastic properties for the strip problem is similar to that obtained for the infinite body problem even when the cohesive zone length is large compared to the height of the strip. The fracture energy also depends on the crack speed v through the dimensionless parameter v$\tau$/L∞ where L∞ is the characteristic length of the cohesive zone and $\tau$ is the characteristic relaxation time of the bulk material. This relationship confirms that at least two properties of the fracture process must be prescribed accurately to model viscoelastic crack growth. In contrast, the fracture energy and crack speed are insensitive to the strip height even in situations where the growth of the dissipation zone is severely constrained by the strip boundaries. We observe that at high speeds, where the fracture energy asymptotically approaches the maximum value, the material surrounding the cohesive zone is in the rubbery (equilibrium) state and not the glassy state. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.},

abstract = {The elasticity of a solid can vary depending on its state of deformation. For example, metals will soften and polymers may stiffen as they are deformed to levels approaching failure. It is only when the deformation is infinitesimally small that elastic moduli can be considered constant, and hence the elasticity linear. Yet, many existing theories model fracture using linear elasticity, despite the fact that materials will experience extreme deformations at crack tips. Here we show by large-scale atomistic simulations that the elastic behaviour observed at large strains--hyperelasticity--can play a governing role in the dynamics of fracture, and that linear theory is incapable of fully capturing all fracture phenomena. We introduce the concept of a characteristic length scale for the energy flux near the crack tip, and demonstrate that the local hyperelastic wave speed governs the crack speed when the hyperelastic zone approaches this energy length scale.},

abstract = {Simulation of generalized fracture and fragmentation remains an ongoing challenge in computational fracture mechanics. There are diculties associated not only with the formulation of physically based models of material failure, but also with the numerical methods required to treat geometries that change in time. The issue of fracture criteria is addressed in this work through a cohesive view of materials, meaning that a {\textregistered}nite material strength and work to fracture are included in the material description. In this study, both surface and bulk cohesive formulations are presented for modeling brittle fracture, detailing the derivation of the formulations, {\textregistered}tting relations, and providing a critical assessment of their capabilities in numerical simulations of fracture. Due to their inherent adaptivity and robustness under severe deformation, meshfree methods are especially well suited to modeling fracture behavior. Described are the applications of meshfree methods to both bulk and surface approaches to cohesive modeling. Numerical examples are provided to highlight the capabilities and shortcomings of the methods in order to identify which approaches are best suited to modeling dierent types of fracture phenomena. {\'{O}}},

@article{Knowles1973,
abstract = {This paper contains an asymptotic treatment, consistent with the fully nonlinear equilibrium theory of compressible elastic solids, of the stresses and deformations near the tip of a traction-free crack in a slab of all-around infinite extent under conditions of plane strain. The loading applied at infinity is taken to be one of uniform uniaxial tension at right angles to the faces of the crack. For the particular class of elastic materials considered the tensile stress in large homogeneous uni-axial extension is asymptotic to a continuously adjustable power of the corresponding principal stretch. The asymptotic analysis of the foregoing crack problem is reduced to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, the solution of which is established in closed form, in terms of elementary functions and a transcendental integral of such functions. This solution involves two arbitrary constants, one of which governs the amplitude of the ensuing elastostatic field near the tip of the crack. A precise estimate of the amplitude parameter, valid at sufficiently small load intensities, is deduced with the aid of a known conservation law. The remaining arbitrary constant, which is left indeterminate by the present lowest-order asymptotic analysis, does not affect the dominant behavior of the field quantities of primary physical interest. II-lustrative numerical results, appropriate to both hardening and softening materials, are presented.},

@article{Steinmann2009,
abstract = {Over the recent years configurational mechanics has developed into a very active and successful topic both in continuum mechanics as well as in computational mechanics. On the continuum mechanics side the basic idea is to consider energy variations that go along with changes of the material configuration. Configurational forces are then energetically dual to these configurational changes. Configurational forces take the interpretation as being the driving forces in the kinetics of defects; like e.g., cracks, inclusions, phase boundaries, dislocations and the like. On the computational side it turns out that a discretisation scheme brings in artificial, discrete configurational forces that indicate in a certain sense the quality, e.g., of a finite-element mesh. This information can then be used to optimize the nodal material positions. Surprisingly, even driven by energetical arguments, it turns out that a finite element mesh optimized with respect to discrete configurational forces also renders superior results in terms of classical error measures. The manuscript will span the field from the underlying theoretical foundations over the algorithmic challenges to various computational applications. {\textcopyright} 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

@article{Menzel2007,
abstract = {The main goal of this work consists in the elaboration of the material or rather configurational mechanics in the context of multiplicative elastoplasticity. This nowadays well-established approach, which is inherently related to the concept of a material isomorphism or in other words to a local rearrangement, is adopted as a paradigm for the general modelling of finite inelasticity. The overall motion in space is throughout assumed to be compatible and sufficiently smooth. According to the underlying configurations, namely the material and the spatial configuration as well as what we call the intermediate configuration, different representations of balance of linear momentum are set up for the static case. The underlying flux terms are thereby identified as stress tensors of Piola and Cauchy type and are assumed to derive from a free energy density function, thus taking hyperelastic formats. Moreover, the incorporated source terms, namely the configurational volume forces, are identified by comparison arguments. These quantities include gradients of distortions as well as dislocation density tensors. In particular those dislocation density tensors related to the elastic or plastic distortion do not vanish due to the general incompatibility of the intermediate configuration. As a result, configurational volume forces which are settled in the intermediate configuration embody non-vanishing dislocation density tensors while their material counterparts directly incorporate non-vanishing gradients of distortions. This fundamental property enables us to recover the celebrated Peach-Koehler force for finite inelasticity, acting on a single dislocation, from the intermediate configuration volume forces. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast to the elastic case, the energy release rate of brittle fracture is a function of crack speed. The formal factorization of the Wiener-Hopf equation is performed numerically. Specific numerical results for the variation of the stress intensity factor with crack speed are presented for the three-parameter viscoelastic solid. Variations in the disparity of the long- and short-time moduli are found to have a greater effect on the stress intensity factor than changes of several decades in the relaxation-time.

abstract = {A dynamic crack tip equation of motion is proposed based on the autonomy of the near-tip nonlinear zone of scale l(nl), symmetry principles, causality, and scaling arguments. Causality implies that the asymptotic linear-elastic fields at time t are determined by the crack path at a retarded time t-tau(d), where the delay time tau(d) scales with the ratio of l(nl) and the typical wave speed c(nl) within the nonlinear zone. The resulting equation is shown to agree with known results in the quasistatic regime. As a first application in the fully dynamic regime, an approximate analysis predicts a high-speed oscillatory instability whose characteristic scale is determined by l(nl).

@article{Lopez-Pamies2011,
abstract = {It is by now well established that loading conditions with sufficiently large triaxialities can induce the sudden appearance of internal cavities within elastomeric (and other soft) solids. The occurrence of such instabilities, commonly referred to as cavitation, can be attributed to the growth of pre-existing defects into finite sizes. This paper introduces a new theory to study the phenomenon of cavitation in soft solids that: (i) allows to consider general 3D loading conditions with arbitrary triaxiality, (ii) applies to large (including compressible and anisotropic) classes of nonlinear elastic solids, and (iii) incorporates direct information on the initial shape, spatial distribution, and mechanical properties of the underlying defects at which cavitation can initiate. The basic idea is to first cast cavitation in elastomeric solids as a homogenization problem of nonlinear elastic materials containing random distributions of zero-volume cavities, or defects. This problem is then addressed by means of a novel iterated homogenization procedure, which allows to construct solutions for a specific, yet fairly general, class of defects. These include solutions for the change in size of the defects as a function of the applied loading conditions, from which the onset of cavitation - corresponding to the event when the initially infinitesimal defects suddenly grown into finite sizes - can be readily determined. In spite of the generality of the proposed approach, the relevant calculations amount to solving tractable HamiltonJacobi equations, in which the initial size of the defects plays the role of time and the applied load plays the role of space. When specialized to the case of hydrostatic loading conditions, isotropic solids, and defects that are vacuous and isotropically distributed, the proposed theory recovers the classical result of Ball (1982) for radially symmetric cavitation. The nature and implications of this remarkable connection are discussed in detail. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Following earlier observations of multiple micro-crack formation accompanying crack propagation under dynamic conditions, the question regarding the discrepancy between the 'theoretically anticipated' maximal crack (Rayleigh wave) speed and those observed typically in amorphous, isotropic solids is examined experimentally. It is shown that if the production of these multiple micro-cracks ahead of the main fracture is suppressed by fabricating a material possessing a thin uniform region of vanishing intrinsic (molecular/atomic) material strength, the crack speed is materially increased to the point of approaching the Rayleigh wave speed. Moreover, it is also shown that the presence of small discreet flaws of sufficient spatial density similarly 'weakens' the material to produce fracture speeds comparable to the Rayleigh wave speed. One deduces, therefore, that for a single crack front the linearized theory of elastodynamics correctly predicts the dynamic crack propagation behavior of a solid with sufficiently low material strength.},

The role of the triaxiality of the stress siate in determining whether decohesion or localization occurs first is investigated. A parametric study is also carried out for a crystal matrix using two desaiptions of the interface shear behaviour: one is periodic in the s h e a displacement across the interface. while the other allows for shear decohesion 1. Introduction Void nucleation by inclusion debonding plays a key role in determining the ductility and toughness of a wide variety of structural metals and metal-based composites. Once the voids nucleate, they grow by plastic deformation of the surrounding matrix material until they eventually coalesce. A continuum-interface model aimed at providing a unified W e w o r k for describing the evolution from initial debonding through decohesion and subsequent void growth was developed in Needleman (1987). In this formulation, constitutive relations are specified independently for the matrix, the particle and the interface. The interface constitutive relation is such that, with increasing interfacial separation, the traction across the interface reaches a maximum, decreases and eventually vanishes. A characteristic length scale is introduced because the interface description involves both a strength and a work of separation. In previous void-nucleation studies within this framework, e.g. Needleman (1987). Nutt and Needleman (1987). Povirk et ul(1991). the plastic response of the ductile phase has been described by a phenomenological theory of plasticity with isotropic hardening. However, the void-nucleating particles in the materials of interest in these studies are typically on the order of 0.1-1.0 pm. At this size scale, the crystallographic nature of metal plasticity can come into play. The discreteness of crystallographic slip systems leads to a directional dependence of plastic flow that is not accounted for by the isotropic-hardening model. Furthermore, because there are high strains at the particle-matrix interface, textural-softening-induced shear-band localizations can occur.},

Unvulcanized rubber has been found to tear in a relatively steady manner, in contrast to the stick-slip tear behavior of the vulcanized rubbber, the tearing energy being dependent on the rate of tearing. Crystallization seems to be an important factor in determining the tear behavior since it has not been found possible to tear unvulcanized SBR under the same conditions. The effect of the pronounced imperfect elastic nature of the material was studied under conditions where the driving force for tearing was solely governed by the rate of release of elastic energy. Under such conditions, it has been found that the tearing energy is determined not by the strain energy required to stretch the material but by the energy which can be recovered on retraction.},

abstract = {Cracks, the major vehicle for material failure, tend to accelerate to high velocities in brittle materials. In three-dimensions, cracks generically undergo a micro-branching instability at about 40{\%} of their sonic limiting velocity. Recent experiments showed that in sufficiently thin systems cracks unprecedentedly accelerate to nearly their limiting velocity without micro-branching, until they undergo an oscillatory instability. Despite their fundamental importance and apparent similarities to other instabilities in condensed-matter physics and materials science, these dynamic fracture instabilities remain poorly understood. They are not described by the classical theory of cracks, which assumes that linear elasticity is valid inside a stressed material and uses an extraneous local symmetry criterion to predict crack paths. Here we develop a model of two-dimensional dynamic brittle fracture capable of predicting arbitrary paths of ultra-high-speed cracks in the presence of elastic nonlinearity without extraneous criteria. We show, by extensive computations, that cracks undergo a dynamic oscillatory instability controlled by small-scale elastic nonlinearity near the crack tip. This instability occurs above a ultra-high critical velocity and features an intrinsic wavelength that increases proportionally to the ratio of the fracture energy to an elastic modulus, in quantitative agreement with experiments. This ratio emerges as a fundamental scaling length assumed to play no role in the classical theory of cracks, but shown here to strongly influence crack dynamics. Those results pave the way for resolving other long-standing puzzles in the failure of materials.},

An in vitro model was used to simulate a vertical force at the interdental wire. Twenty-six pairs of incisors were placed in two groups. A 15 mm length of wire was bonded to the lingual surfaces of each pair of incisors using a common bonding technique. A vertical force was applied to the midpoint of the interdental wire, using an Instron universal testing machine. The failure characteristics examined included the maximum force for debond, the degree of wire deformation, and the site of failure.Significance was predetermined at P {\textless} 0.05 and multiple comparisons indicated no significant differences (P = 0.147) in the initial mean bond strength between the 0.0175 inch (41.44 N) and 0.016 × 0.022 inch (37.70 N) wires. The main failure type for both the initial and second debond events was fracture of composite bond at the wire-composite interface, cohesive failure. Both wires exhibited similar mean degrees of deflection of 1.30 and 1.51 mm for the 0.0175 inch and 0.016 × 0.022 inch wires, respectively. Rebonding to enamel resulted in significantly lower (P = 0.001) mean bond strength for both wires, 0.0175 inch (13.86 N) and 0.016 × 0.022 inch (14.17 N) in comparison with the initial bond strength. Rebonding to previously bonded enamel may be unpredictable and may lead to higher failure rates of bonded lingual retainers. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.

abstract = {The problem of adhesion at the interface between two polymers is investigated using a fracture mechanics approach. The effect of viscoelastic deformation of the bulk polymers and the micromechanical behavior of the interface on the fracture toughness of the interface was investigated by analyzing the problem of a steadily growing interface crack under the condition of small scale yielding. This condition assumes that the region of displacement discontinuity across the interface (the adhesive zone) due to loss of adhesion is small compared with typical specimen dimensions. It is found that the amount of inelastic or viscous energy dissipation is strongly coupled to the interface behavior and that the measured interface fracture toughness can be much higher than the intrinsic interface fracture toughness. For sufficiently high crack growth rates, a simple expression is obtained which relates the rate of viscous energy dissipation and the intrinsic interface fracture toughness to the viscoelastic properties of the bulk polymer. The dependence of the stress field inside the adhesive zone and the length of the adhesive zone on the viscoelastic properties of the polymer, the applied loading, the interface micromechanical model and the crack growth rate ȧ is obtained by numerically solving an integral equation. The size of the region of the viscoelastic energy dissipation is found to scale with ȧ$\tau$r, where $\tau$ris the retardation time of the bulk polymer.},

abstract = {The experimental study of adhesion between common solids is bedevilled by the fad that, with exception of cleaved mica, inevitable roughness of the surfaces is greater than the range of surface forces. A new situation arose with the technique of casting low-modulus rubber with an optically smooth surface. When placed in contact with each other, or with a smooth hard surface like plate glass, such specimens are sufficiently compliant to make intimate contact throughout the whole of their apparent contact area. High adhesion is then observed; in fact the measured force required to separate the surfaces is generally greatly in excess of that which would be expected from the action of surface forces alone. The measured force of adhesion is found to depend on the rate of separation and to correlate with the viscoelastic properties of the rubber. The present state of knowledge of this phenomenon is reviewed and the mechanics of the process whereby the viscoelastic properties of the solids amplify their true surface energy is explained. {\textcopyright} 1981 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, London, UK. Crack growth dynamics is studied experimentally and analyzed focusing on both kinetics and crack tip profiles utilizing acrylonitrile butadiene rubbers which are filled with different amounts of carbon black. The behavior of crack growth is characterized by the relation between the tearing energy and the crack growth rate, and all samples show the discontinuous transition of the crack growth rate between the ‘slow mode' and ‘fast mode' in a narrow range of the tearing energy. In the ‘fast mode' crack growth rate (about 1–100 m/sec) shows a power-law relationship with the tearing energy, while in the ‘slow mode' the crack growth rate (about 0.01–1 mm/sec) exhibits no definite dependence on the tearing energy. The high resolution measurements reveals that the features of the crack tip profile drastically change at the discontinuous transition of the crack growth rate. The crack tip profiles observed are characterized by the gap from the parabolic profile expected by Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). The weakly nonlinear elasticity theory on fracture dynamics, which considers the contribution of the second-order modulus to the strain field, successfully explains the small gaps ( {\textless}  ca. 1 mm) independently of whether the mode of interestis ‘slow' or ‘fast'.

abstract = {A new viscoelastic cohesive zone model is formulated for large deformation conditions and within a fully coupled thermomechanical framework. The model is suitable for the simulation of a wide range of problems especially for polymeric materials. It can capture viscoelastic crack propagation as well as energy dissipation due to this process. Starting from the principles of thermodynamics, a 3D finite element formulation is derived for a fully coupled simultaneous solution of the thermal field and the deformation field. The viscoelastic model is constructed by extending an elastic exponential traction separation law using a simple rheology. The viscous part of the tractions is postulated to have the same characteristic length as the elastic part and that they are related by a single material parameter. A Newtonian dashpot is used to describe the evolution of the viscous separation. Furthermore, thermal effects are accounted for using temperature expressions in both the traction laws and the viscosity of the dashpot, and using a heat conduction law across the interface. The model is implemented within an implicit finite element code and the internal variable is calculated using an internal iteration. Different numerical examples are used to verify the model and a comparison with experimental data shows a satisfactory agreement. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A novel viscous dissipation potential is proposed for the visco-hyperelastic constitutive modeling of short-time memory responses of soft materials, which can capture both linear and nonlinear large deformation behaviors over a wide range of strain rates. The proposed potential is compatible with objectivity and continuum thermodynamics principles, consists of physically motivated model parameters, and adds the capability of modeling strain rate sensitivity in the small strain regime, which is currently not possible with available external state variable driven viscous dissipation potentials. By combining the proposed viscous dissipation potential with the Mooney-Rivlin strain energy density function, a visco-hyperelastic relation is formulated and fit to the rate-dependent tensile stress-strain data of human patellar tendon, which was previously modeled using an existing viscous dissipation potential. It is demonstrated that the proposed model offers improvements in fitting accuracy and prevents possible thermodynamic instabilities in quasi-static hyperelastic models from corrupting the dynamic response. In addition, the uncomplicated mathematical form of the model and the accompanying multi-step multi-start optimization procedure helps prevent numerical instabilities. Multi-deformation mode fitting of human brain gray matter under all three primary deformation modes (compression, tension and shear) is also considered using a visco-hyperelastic model based on the proposed potential and the semi-empirical Gent-Gent strain energy density function. It is shown that visco-hyperelastic models based on the proposed viscous dissipation potential capture all the essential features of the stress-strain data with unique optimal model parameters, giving reasonable accuracy in both single and multiple deformation mode cases. Further, it is demonstrated that the proposed model is stable and robust with respect to both the choice of the hyperelastic strain energy density and the availability of data from multiple deformation modes.},

First, it is shown that the near tip stress field for running cracks has universal spatial dependence in a coordinate system local to the crack tip. The rate at which energy is absorbed by the running crack can then be calculated in terms of the crack motion and the scalar stress intensity factors. The fact that this rate of energy absorption is positive for any running crack plays a central role in the subsequent proof of the uniqueness theorem. The results apply for arbitrary motion of a curved crack, provided that the crack tip speed is less than the Rayleigh wave speed of the material. {\textcopyright} 1974 Noordhoff International Publishing.},

abstract = {The dynamics of planar crack fronts in hetergeneous media near the critical load for onset of crack motion are investigated both analytically and by numerical simulations. Elasticity of the solid leads to long-range stress transfer along the crack front which is nonmonotonic in time due to the elastic waves in the medium. In the quasistatic limit with instantaneous stress transfer, the crack front exhibits dynamic critical phenomenon, with a second-order-like transition from a pinned to a moving phase as the applied load is increased through a critical value. At criticality, the crack front is self-affine, with a roughness exponent zeta=0.34+/-0.02. The dynamic exponent z is found to be equal to 0.74+/-0.03 and the correlation length exponent nu=1.52+/-0.02. These results are in good agreement with those obtained from an epsilon expansion. Sound-travel time delays in the stress transfer do not change the static exponents but the dynamic exponent z becomes exactly one. Real elastic waves, however, lead to overshoots in the stresses above their eventual static value when one part of the crack front moves forward. Simplified models of these stress overshoots are used to show that overshoots are relevant at the depinning transition leading to a decrease in the critical load and an apparent jump in the velocity of the crack front directly to a nonzero value. In finite systems, the velocity also shows hysteretic behavior as a function of the loading. These results suggest a first-order-like transition. Possible implications for real tensile cracks are discussed.},

Among them, the ability of reproducing the highly nonlinear rate-dependent stress response and the post-yield strain softening phenomenon. The simplicity of the proposition allows to recover the same mathematical structure of classical constitutive approaches, well suited for the use of implicit finite element codes. To this aim, the flow resistance concept, elsewhere known as shear strength, is reframed as a state variable of an accumulated strain measure. Three alternative expressions for this function are presented. The model is cast within a variational framework in which consistent constitutive updates are obtained by a minimization procedure. Convenient choices for the conservative and dissipative potentials reduce the local constitutive problem to the solution of a single nonlinear scalar equation, emulating the simplest case of viscoelastic models. Numerical tests on the constitutive model show excellent agreement with experimental data. Finally, a 3D simulation of a standard specimen with heterogeneous material properties illustrates the ability of the present proposition to be implemented in implicit finite element codes.},

abstract = {Gradient-enhanced damage models and phase-field models are seemingly very disparate approaches to fracture. Whereas gradient-enhanced damage models find their roots in damage mechanics, which is a smeared approach from the onset, and gradients were added to restore well-posedness beyond a critical strain level, the phase-field approach to brittle fracture departs from a discontinuous description of failure, where the distribution function is regularised, leading to the inclusion of spatial gradients as well. Herein, we will consider both approaches, and discuss their similarities and differences. The averaging (diffusion) equations for the averaging field and the phase-field will be compared, and it is shown that the diffusion equation for the phase-field can be conceived as a special case of the averaging equation of a gradient-damage model where the damage is averaged. Further, the role of the driving force is examined, and it is shown that subtle differences in the degradation functions commonly adopted in damage and phase-field approaches are key to the observation that, different from damage mechanics, the fracture process zone does not broaden in the wake of the crack tip.},

abstract = {Constitute equations for finite deformation, isotropic, elastic-viscoplastic solids are formulated. The concept of a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastic and a plastic part is used. The constitutive equation for stress is a hyperelastic relation in terms of the logarithmic elastic strain. Since the material is assumed to be isotropic in every local configuration determined by the plastic part of deformation gradient, the internal variables are necessarily scalars. We use a single scalar as an internal variable to represent the isotropic resistance to plastic flow offered by the internal state of the material. The constitutive equation for stress is often expressed in a rate form, and for metals it is common to approximate this rate equation, under the assumption of infinitesimal elastic strains, to arrive at a hypoelastic equation for the stress. Here, we do not express the stress constitutive equation in a rate form, nor do we make this approximative assumption. For the total form of the stress equation we present a new implicit procedure for updating the stress and other relevant variables. Also, the principle of virtual work is linearized to obtain a consistent, closed-from elasto-viscoplastic tangent operator (the 'Jacobian') for use in solving for global balance of linear momentum in implicit, two-point, deformation driven finite element algorithms. The time integration algorithm is implemented in the finite element program ABAQUS. To check the accuracy and stability of the algorithm, some representative problems involving large, pure elastic and combined elastic-plastic deformations are solved. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Configurational forces and couples acting on a dynamically evolving fracture process region as well as their balance are studied with special emphasis to microstructure and dissipation. To be able to investigate fracture process regions preceding cracks of mode I, II and III we choose as underlying continuum model the polar and micropolar, respectively, continuum with dislocation motion on the microlevel. As point of departure balance of macroforces, balance of couples and balance of microforces acting on dislocations are postulated. Taking into account results of the second law of thermodynamics the stress power principle for dissipative processes is derived. Applying this principle to a fracture process region evolving dynamically in the reference configuration with variable rotational and crystallographic structure, the configurational forces and couples are derived generalizing the well-known Eshelby tensor. It is shown that the balance law of configurational forces and couples reflects the structure of the postulated balance laws on macro- and microlevel: the balance law of configurational forces and configurational couples are coupled by field variable, while the balance laws of configurational macro- and microforces are coupled only by the form of the free energy. They can be decoupled by corresponding constitutive assumption. Finally, it is shown that the second law of thermodynamics leads to the result that the generalized Eshelby tensor for micropolar continua with dislocation motion consists of a non-dissipative part, derivable from free and kinetic energy, and a dissipative part, derivable from a dissipation pseudo-potential. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Following a quantitative characterization of the microcracking patterns, a very simple nucleation and growth model is then put forward.

While all these are important, the decisive role of nonlocality needs to be particularly emphasized.

abstract = {The phase-field model has been employed for fracture analysis over the last decade. One of the main advantages is that the fracture evolution does not depend on any explicit criterion. Good agreement is obtained by comparing the results of simulations and experiments. Most elastomers exhibit both elastic and viscous behavior simultaneously, which yields rate-dependent properties for both the mechanical and fracture responses. In this contribution, a viscoelastic rheological model based on Reese and Govindjee (Int J Solids Struct 35:3455–3482, 1998) is coupled to phase-field modeling to investigate rate-dependent fracture within elastomers. The elastic strain energy potential supposed to evolve fracture is provided by both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium branches. The fracture mechanism is characterized by a volumetric–isochoric split, which specifies a varying driving force in the case of tensile or compressive deformation. Representative numerical examples are studied and related findings and potential perspectives are summarized to close the paper.},

@article{ogden2011,
abstract = {In this paper, the general constitutive equation for a transversely isotropic hyperelastic solid in the presence of initial stress is derived, based on the theory of invariants. In the general finite deformation case for a compressible material this requires 18 invariants (17 for an incompressible material). The equations governing infinitesimal motions superimposed on a finite deformation are then used in conjunction with the constitutive law to examine the propagation of both homogeneous plane waves and, with the restriction to two dimensions, Rayleigh surface waves. For this purpose we consider incompressible materials and a restricted set of invariants that is sufficient to capture both the effects of initial stress and transverse isotropy. Moreover, the equations are specialized to the undeformed configuration in order to compare with the classical formulation of Biot. One feature of the general theory is that the speeds of homogeneous plane waves and surface waves depend nonlinearly on the initial stress, in contrast to the situation of the more specialized isotropic and orthotropic theories of Biot. The speeds of (homogeneous plane) shear waves and Rayleigh waves in an incompressible material are obtained and the significant differences from Biot's results for both isotropic and transversely isotropic materials are highlighted with calculations based on a specific form of strain-energy function.},

@article{Haupt2002,
abstract = {The assumption of incompressibility as a kinematic constraint condition leads to consequences, which are of physical interest in view of a thermodynamically consistent material modelling. Some of these consequences are discussed within the concept of finite linear viscoelasticity. We present two natural possibilities to generalise the familiar Maxwell-model to finite strains; both tensor-valued differential equations are integrated to yield the present Cauchy stress as a functional of the relative Piola or Green strain history. Both types of Maxwell-models are related to a free energy functional in the sense that the dissipation inequality is satisfied. The stress and energy functionals are generalised to incorporate arbitrary kernel functions of relaxation; the only restriction for thermodynamic consistency is that the relaxation functions have a negative slope and a positive curvature. The linear combination of the two types of energy functionals can be understood to be a generalisation of the Mooney-Rivlin model to viscoelasticity. The concrete representation of relaxation functions, motivated from a finite series of Maxwell-elements in parallel, implies a Prony series, corresponding to a discrete relaxation spectrum. A compact notation to express a continuous relaxation spectrum is provided by the concept of a derivative of fractional order. In particular, differential equations of fractional order lead to relaxation functions coming very close to the relaxation behaviour of real materials. As an example, the evolution equation of a fractional Maxwell-model is solved, leading to a relaxation function of the Mittag-Leffler type. An essential advantage is that a rather small number of material constants is involved in this model, while the accuracy of its prediction is quite good. Physically nonlinear effects, such as process-dependent viscosity and relaxation behaviour can be incorporated into finite linear viscoelasticity, if the natural time is replaced with a material-dependent time scale. The rate of the material-dependent time then depends on further internal variables to account for the influence of the process history; this kind of proceeding is fully compatible with the entropy inequality. Temperature-dependence is included, starting from a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into mechanical and thermal parts. The resulting constitutive theory has a rather simple structure and offers a considerable degree of freedom to allow for physically important phenomena. The numerical simulations illustrate a small selection of these possibilities.},

Furthermore, efficient modelling of arbitrary crack growth by use of XFEM (extended finite element method) requires accurate knowledge of the asymptotic crack tip fields. In the present work, we perform an asymptotic analysis of the mechanical fields in the vicinity of a propagating mode I crack in rubber. Plane deformation is assumed, and the material model is based on the Langevin function, which accounts for the finite extensibility of polymer chains. The Langevin function is approximated by a polynomial, and only the term of the highest order contributes to the asymptotic solution. The crack is predicted to adopt a wedge-like shape, i.e. the crack faces will be straight lines. The angle of the wedge and the order of the stress singularity depend on the hardening of the strain energy function. The present analysis shows that in materials with a significant hardening, the inertia term in the equations of motion becomes negligible in the asymptotic analysis. Hence, there is no upper theoretical limit to the crack speed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Continuous models of material degradation may cease to produced meaningful results in the presence of high strain gradients. These gradients may occur for instance in the propagation of waves with high wave numbers and at stress concentrators. Adding nonlocal or gradient terms to the constitutive modelling may enhance the ability of the models to describe such situations. The effect of adding nonlocal or gradient terms and the relation between these enhancements are examined in a continuum damage setting. A nonlocal damage model and two different gradient damage models are considered. In one of the gradient models higher order deformation gradients enter the equilibrium equations explicity, while in the other model the gradient influence follows in a more implicit way from an additional partial differential equation. The latter, implicit gradient formulation can be rewritten in the integral format of the nonlocal model and can therefore be regarded as truly nonlocal. This is not true for the explicit formulation, in which the nonlocality is limited to an infinitesimal volume. This fundamental difference between the formulations results in quite different behaviour in wave propagation, localisation and at crack tips. This is shown for the propagation of waves in the models, their localisation properties and the behaviour at a crack tip. The responses of the nonlocal model and the implicit gradient model agree remarkably well in these situations, while the explicit gradient formulation shows an entirely different and sometimes nonphysical response. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Extension to viscoelastic media is then made. Although the undamaged portion of the continuum is assumed linear, no significant restrictions are placed on the nature of the zone of failing material at the crack tip and, therefore, this material may be highly nonlinear, rate-dependent, and even discontinuous. Finally, formulation of the problem is completed by introducing a local energy criterion of failure at the tip which is applicable to both constant and transient tip velocities.

Because the stress-strain curve changes from concave to convex as the strain increases, the governing quasi-linear system of partial differential equations, though hyperbolic, fails to be "genuinely nonlinear" so that the standard form of the boundary-initial value problem corresponding to impact is not well-posed at all levels of loading. When the problem fails to be well-posed, it does so by exhibiting a massive loss of uniqueness, even though an entropy-like dissipation inequality is in force. Because the breakdown in uniqueness is reminiscent of a similar phenomenon that occurs in continuum-mechanical models for impact-induced phase transitions, a mathematically suitable, though physically unmotivated, supplementary selection mechanism for determining the solution naturally suggests itself. We describe in detail the solutions determined by two special forms of this selection mechanism, and we show that these two solutions provide bounds on the impact response, regardless of the selection principle used.},

@article{Kumar2018a,
abstract = {A macroscopic theory is proposed to describe, explain, and predict the nucleation and propagation of fracture and healing in elastomers undergoing arbitrarily large quasistatic deformations. The theory, which can be viewed as a natural generalization of the phase-field approximation of the variational theory of brittle fracture of Francfort and Marigo (1998) to account for physical attributes innate to elastomers that have been recently unveiled by experiments at high spatio-temporal resolution, rests on two central ideas. The first one is to view elastomers as solids capable to undergo finite elastic deformations and capable also to phase transition to another solid of vanishingly small stiffness: the forward phase transition serves to model the nucleation and propagation of fracture while the reverse phase transition models the possible healing. The second central idea is to take the phase transition to be driven by the competition between a combination of strain energy and hydrostatic stress concentration in the bulk and surface energy on the created/healed new surfaces in the elastomer. From an applications point of view, the proposed theory amounts to solving a system of two coupled and nonlinear PDEs for the deformation field and an order parameter, or phase field. A numerical scheme is presented to generate solutions for these PDEs in N=2 and 3 space dimensions. This is based on an efficient non-conforming finite-element discretization, which remains stable for large deformations and elastomers of any compressibility, together with an implicit gradient flow solver, which is able to deal with the large changes in the deformation field that can ensue locally in space and time from the nucleation of fracture. The last part of this paper is devoted to presenting sample simulations of the so-called Gent–Park experiment. Those are confronted with recent experimental results for various types of silicone elastomers.},

abstract = {A rapidly moving crack in a brittle material is often idealized as a one-dimensional object with a singular tip, moving through a two-dimensional material. However, in real three-dimensional materials, tensile cracks form a planar surface whose edge is a rapidly moving one-dimensional singular front. The dynamics of these fronts under repetitive interaction with material inhomogeneities (asperities) and the morphology of the fracture surface that they create are not yet understood. Here we show that perturbations to a crack front in a brittle material result in long-lived and highly localized waves, which we call 'front waves' These waves exhibit a unique characteristic shape and propagate along the crack front at approximately the Rayleigh wave speed (the speed of sound along a free surface). Following interaction, counter-propagating front waves retain both their shape and amplitude. They create characteristic traces along the fracture surface, providing cracks with both inertia and a new mode of dissipation. Front waves are intrinsically three-dimensional, and cannot exist in conventional two-dimensional theories of fracture. Because front waves can transport and distribute asperity-induced energy fluctuations throughout the crack front, they may help to explain how cracks remain a single coherent entity, despite repeated interactions with randomly dispersed asperities.},

In this dissertation, the applied theory of vector Riemann–Hilbert problems is reviewed. The analytical solu- tion representing the problem on a Riemann surface, and a numerical solution that reduces the problem to singular integral equations, are considered, as well as a combination of the numerical and analytical techniques (partial Wiener–Hopf factorization) is proposed. In this work, we begin with a brief survey of the Riemann–Hilbert problem: constructing solution of the scalar Riemann–Hilbert problem for a class of H¨ older continuous functions; considering classes of matrices that admit the closed-form solution of the vector Riemann– Hilbert problem; discussing numerical and analytical techniques of constructing solutions of vector Riemann–Hilbert problems. We continue with applications of the Wiener–Hopf technique to problems of Dynamic fracture mechanics: reviewing well-known solutions to problems on propagation of a semi- infinite crack in an unbounded plane in the cases of a stationary crack, a crack propagating at a constant speed, and a crack propagating at a non-uniform arbitrary speed. Based on those, we derive solutions to new problems on a semi-infinite crack propagation in a half- plane (steady-state and transient problems for subsonic speeds) as well as in a composite strip (for intersonic speeds).

abstract = {A material force method is proposed for evaluating the energy release rate and work rate of dissipation for fracture in inelastic materials. The inelastic material response is characterized by an internal variable model with an explicitly defined free energy density and dissipation potential. Expressions for the global material and dissipation forces are obtained from a global balance of energy–momentum that incorporates dissipation from inelastic material behavior. It is shown that in the special case of steady-state growth, the global dissipation force equals the work rate of dissipation, and the global material force and J-integral methods are equivalent. For implementation in finite element computations, an equivalent domain expression of the global material force is developed from the weak form of the energy–momentum balance. The method is applied to model problems of cohesive fracture in a remote K-field for viscoelasticity and elastoplasticity. The viscoelastic problem is used to compare various element discretizations in combination with different schemes for computing strain gradients. For the elastoplastic problem, the effects of cohesive and bulk properties on the plastic dissipation are examined using calculations of the global dissipation force.},

abstract = {We derive a thermodynamically-consistent, three-dimensional, rate form-based finite-deformation constitutive theory and computational approach for damage {\&} fracture in nonlinear viscoelastic materials. The key ingredient that allows us to develop a physical criterion for fracture is the use of a Gibbs potential-based multinetwork formulation of viscoelasticity. An approach that is based on the use of the criticality of the averaged Gibbs potential over a fracture process zone is used for the initiation {\&} propagation of cracks in a body. The rate form-based constitutive theory and fracture criterion are implemented into the Abaqus (2018) finite-element program through a user-material subroutine interface. Crack propagation is modeled as the failure of elements leading to loss of mechanical resistance to deformation. The tearing {\&} fracture response of a viscoelastic material using a notch-in-plate sample deformed in simple tension is also simulated. By comparing the simulation results for a local damage criterion versus a truly nonlocal damage criterion, we show how the spread of Gibbs free energy around the crack tip influences the nature of the crack growth. As expected, the material fracture response described by a local damage criterion exhibits pathological mesh dependence whereas the response obtained using the nonlocal damage criterion is mesh objective regardless of mesh density, element type and orientation. This work presents two major computational advances: (1) the conversion of the rate form-based finite-deformation constitutive theory into an objective time-integration procedure is straightforward because the material time derivative-based constitutive equations are frame-invariant, and (2) the physically-observed crack initiation {\&} propagation process in solids can be accurately {\&} robustly simulated using simple numerical techniques such as the element failure method if a truly nonlocal fracture criterion is utilized. Finally, we benchmark results obtained from our computational framework and numerical simulations for modeling crack initiation {\&} propagation to physical experimental data of mixed-mode crack propagation in a viscoelastic material.},

abstract = {We have studied cracks traveling along weak interfaces. We model them using harmonic and anharmonic forces between particles in a lattice, both in tension (Mode I) and antiplane shear (Mode III). One of our main objects has been to determine when supersonic cracks traveling faster than the shear wave speed can occur. In contrast to subsonic cracks, the speed of supersonic cracks is best expressed as a function of strain, not stress intensity factor. Nevertheless, we find that supersonic cracks are more common than has previously been realized. They occur both in Mode I and Mode III, with or without anharmonic changes of interparticle forces prior to breaking, and with or without dissipation. The extent and shape of the supersonic branch of solutions depends strongly on details such as lattice geometry, force law anharmonicity, and amount of dissipation. Particle forces that stiffen prior to breaking lead to larger supersonic branches. Increasing dissipation also tends to promote the existence of supersonic states. We include a number of other results, including analytical expressions for crack speeds in the high-strain limit, and numerical results for the spatial extent of regions where particles interact anharmonically. Finally, we note a curious phenomenon, where for forces that weaken with increasing strain, cracks can slow down when one pulls on them harder.},

It is supersonic, and the speed is determined by strain levels ahead of the tip rather than total strain energy as for ordinary cracks. Dissipation plays a very important role in allowing the propagation of ruptures, and the back edges of ruptures must toughen as they contract, or the rupture is unstable. This article presents several levels of theoretical description of this phenomenon: first, a numerical procedure capable of incorporating large extensions, dynamics, and bond rupture; second, a simple continuum model that can be solved analytically, and which reproduces several features of elementary shock physics; and third, an analytically solvable discrete model that accurately reproduces numerical and experimental results, and explains the scaling laws that underlie this new failure mode. Rupture speeds compare well with experiments, but opening angles of the rupture are not yet captured well. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This work presents a new phase field model for rate-independent crack propagation in rubbery polymers at large strains and considers details of its numerical implementation. The approach accounts for micro-mechanically based features of both the elastic bulk response as well as the crack toughness of idealized polymer networks. The proposed diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a crack phase field overcomes difficulties associated with the computational realization of sharp crack discontinuities, in particular when it comes to complex crack topologies. The crack phase field governs a crack density function, which describes the macroscopic crack surface in the polymer per unit of the reference volume. It provides the basis for the constitutive modeling of a degrading free energy storage and a crack threshold function with a Griffith-type critical energy release rate, that governs the crack propagation in the polymer. Both the energy storage as well as the critical energy release due to fracture can be related to classical statistical network theories of polymers. The proposed framework of diffusive fracture in polymers is formulated in terms of a rate-type variational principle that determines the evolution of the coupled primary variable fields, i.e. the deformation field and the crack phase field. On the computational side, we outline a staggered solution procedure based on a one-pass operator split of the coupled equations, that successively updates in a typical time step the crack phase field and the displacement field. Such a solution algorithm is extremely robust, easy to implement and ideally suited for engineering problems. We finally demonstrate the performance of the phase field formulation of fracture at large strains by means of representative numerical examples. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The mechanical behavior of elastomeric materials is known to be rate-dependent and to exhibit hysteresis upon cyclic loading. Although these features of the rubbery constitutive response are well-recognized and important to its function, few models attempt to quantify these aspects of response perhaps due to the complex nature of the behavior and its apparent inconsistency with regard to current reasonably successful models of rubber elasticity. In this paper a detailed experimental investigation probing the material response of carbon black filled Chloroprene rubber subjected to different time-dependent strain histories is presented. Some of the key observations from the experiments, are: (1) both filled and unfilled elastomers show significant amounts of hysteresis during cyclic loading; (2) the amount of carbon black particles does not strongly influence the normalized amount of hysteresis; (3) both filled and unfilled elastomers are strain-rate dependent and the rate dependence is higher during the uploading than during the unloading; (4) at fixed strain, the stress is observed to approach the same equilibrium level with relaxation time whether loading or unloading. Based on the experimental data a new constitutive model has been developed. The foundation of the model is that the mechanical behavior can be decomposed into two parts: an equilibrium network corresponding to the state that is approached in long time stress relaxation tests; and a second network capturing the non-linear rate-dependent deviation from the equilibrium state. The time-dependence of the second network is further assumed to be governed by the reptational motion of molecules having the ability to significantly change conformation and thereby relaxing the overall stress state. By comparing the predictions from the proposed three-dimensional constitutive model with experimental data for uniaxial compression and plane strain compression we conclude that the constitutive model predicts rate-dependence and relaxation behavior well. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {In the small scale yielding limit, the viscoelastic energy dissipation and the predicted fracture toughness of the interface between two viscoelastic polymers are monotonically increasing functions of the crack growth rate. For a finite size specimen however such prediction are no longer strictly valid. We demonstrate here that there is a maximum viscoelastic energy dissipation (and thus fracture toughness) at a characteristic interface crack velocity which depends not only on the micromechanical properties of the interface and the viscoelastic properties of the bulk polymers but also upon the specimen dimensions. Our analytical results allow us to deduce G=Gad[1+$\phi$ (aTȧ,c)] which relates the experimental fracture toughness to the intrinsic fracture toughness of the interface Gad, the WLF shift factor aT and c, a dimensionless parameter which is a function of the micromechanical properties of the interface, the mechanical properties of the polymers and the specimen dimensions. This result is similar to an empirical relation developed to fit experimental results; this relation however was assumed to be independent of c (specimen geometry). We demonstrate that the dependence of $\phi$ on c is substantially weaker than its dependence on a Tȧ, which accounts for the success of the empirical relation in correlating the experimental data.},

abstract = {The roles of the consistent Jacobian matrix and the material tangent moduli, which are used in nonlinear incremental finite deformation mechanics problems solved using the finite element method, are emphasized in this paper, and demonstrated using the commercial software ABAQUS standard. In doing so, the necessity for correctly employing user material subroutines to solve nonlinear problems involving large deformation and/or large rotation is clarified. Starting with the rate form of the principle of virtual work, the derivations of the material tangent moduli, the consistent Jacobian matrix, the stress/strain measures, and the objective stress rates are discussed and clarified. The difference between the consistent Jacobian matrix (which, in the ABAQUS UMAT user material subroutine is referred to as DDSDDE) and the material tangent moduli (Ce) needed for the stress update is pointed out and emphasized in this paper. While the former is derived based on the Jaumann rate of the Kirchhoff stress, the latter is derived using the Jaumann rate of the Cauchy stress. Understanding the difference between these two objective stress rates is crucial for correctly implementing a constitutive model, especially a rate form constitutive relation, and for ensuring fast convergence. Specifically, the implementation requires the stresses to be updated correctly. For this, the strains must be computed directly from the deformation gradient and corresponding strain measure (for a total form model). Alternatively, the material tangent moduli derived from the corresponding Jaumann rate of the Cauchy stress of the constitutive relation (for a rate form model) should be used. Given that this requirement is satisfied, the consistent Jacobian matrix only influences the rate of convergence. Its derivation should be based on the Jaumann rate of the Kirchhoff stress to ensure fast convergence; however, the use of a different objective stress rate may also be possible. The error associated with energy conservation and work-conjugacy due to the use of the Jaumann objective stress rate in ABAQUS nonlinear incremental analysis is viewed as a consequence of the implementation of a constitutive model that violates these requirements.},

abstract = {Asymptotic analyses of the mechanical fields in front of stationary and propagating cracks are important for several reasons. For example, they facilitate the understanding of the mechanical and physical state in front of crack tips, and they enable prediction of crack growth. Furthermore, efficient modelling of arbitrary crack growth by use of XFEM (extended finite element method) requires accurate knowledge of the asymptotic crack tip fields. The present study focuses on the asymptotic fields in front of a crack that propagates dynamically in rubber. Static analyses of this type of problem have been made in previous studies. In order to be able to compare the present results with these earlier studies, the constitutive model from Knowles and Sternberg (J. Elast. 3:67-107, 1973) was adopted. It is assumed that viscoelastic stresses become negligible compared with the singular elastic stresses close to the crack tip. The present analysis shows that in materials with a significant hardening, the inertia term in the equations of motion becomes negligible in the asymptotic analysis. However, for a neoHookean type of model, inertia comes into play and causes a maximum theoretical crack speed that equals the shear wave speed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper examines, from the prospect of continuum analysis, the possibility for a supersonic crack growth in a solid with an upturn stress-strain relation. The stress has a linear-upturn power-law relation with the strain, resulting in an elastic modulus, and consequently a wave speed, that increase with the strain. Though appearing to be "supersonic", the local wave speed in the crack tip vicinity of the solid with a sufficient upturn stress-strain relation exceeds the crack extension speed. A pre-request for such a supersonic crack growth is the storage of sufficient deformation energy within the solid to nurse the energy flux drawn to the crack tip that extends at an "apparent supersonic" speed. The idea is demonstrated for the simplest case, the anti-plane shear. We examine the steady-state supersonic crack growth in a hyperelastic material. The governing equation is elliptical in the crack tip vicinity but hyperbolic elsewhere. The boundary between two regions is determined with a certain extent. An asymptotic solution is constructed within the super-hardening zone. The solution connects to the hyperbolic radiation strips by weak discontinuity boundaries and to the pre-stressed frontal field by a strong discontinuity boundary. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The fracture of brittle amorphous materials is an especially challenging problem, because the way a large object shatters is intimately tied to details of cohesion at microscopic scales. This subject has been plagued by conceptual puzzles, and to make matters worse, experiments seemed to contradict the most firmly established theories. In this review, we will show that the theory and experiments fit within a coherent picture where dynamic instabilities of a crack tip play a crucial role. To accomplish this task, we first summarize the central results of linear elastic dynamic fracture mechanics, an elegant and powerful description of crack motion from the continuum perspective. We point out that this theory is unable to make predictions without additional input, information that must come either from experiment, or from other types of theories. We then proceed to discuss some of the most important experimental observations, and the methods that were used to obtain the them. Once the flux of energy to a crack tip passes a critical value, the crack becomes unstable, and it propagates in increasingly complicated ways. As a result, the crack cannot travel as quickly as theory had supposed, fracture surfaces become rough, it begins to branch and radiate sound, and the energy cost for crack motion increases considerably. All these phenomena are perfectly consistent with the continuum theory, but are not described by it. Therefore, we close the review with an account of theoretical and numerical work that attempts to explain the instabilities. Currently, the experimental understanding of crack tip instabilities in brittle amorphous materials is fairly detailed. We also have a detailed theoretical understanding of crack tip instabilities in crystals, reproducing qualitatively many features of the experiments, while numerical work is beginning to make the missing connections between experiment and theory.},

abstract = {A new viscoelastic cohesive zone model is formulated for large deformation conditions and within a fully coupled thermomechanical framework. The model is suitable for the simulation of a wide range of problems especially for polymeric materials. It can capture viscoelastic crack propagation as well as energy dissipation due to this process. Starting from the principles of thermodynamics, a 3D finite element formulation is derived for a fully coupled simultaneous solution of the thermal field and the deformation field. The viscoelastic model is constructed by extending an elastic exponential traction separation law using a simple rheology. The viscous part of the tractions is postulated to have the same characteristic length as the elastic part and that they are related by a single material parameter. A Newtonian dashpot is used to describe the evolution of the viscous separation. Furthermore, thermal effects are accounted for using temperature expressions in both the traction laws and the viscosity of the dashpot, and using a heat conduction law across the interface. The model is implemented within an implicit finite element code and the internal variable is calculated using an internal iteration. Different numerical examples are used to verify the model and a comparison with experimental data shows a satisfactory agreement. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Zhuang2014,
abstract = {Rationale: Aneurysm and dissection of the ascending thoracic aorta are the main cardiovascular complications of Marfan syndrome (MFS) resulting in premature death. Studies using mouse models of MFS have shown that activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-$\beta$) and the concomitant upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to aneurysm development. Our previous study showed that doxycycline delayed aneurysm rupture in a mouse model of MFS, Fbn1mgR/mgR. Losartan has been shown to prevent aneurysms in another mouse model of MFS, Fbn1C1039G/+, through inhibition of the Erk1/2 pathway. However, the role of MMP-2 in MFS and effect of losartan on the lifespan of MFS mice remain unknown. Objective: We investigated the role of MMP-2 in MFS and compared the effects of losartan and doxycycline on aortic dilatation and survival in Fbn1mgR/mgR mice. Methods and Results: By life table analysis, we found that losartan and doxycycline improved the survival of Fbn1 mice. Gelatin zymography and Western blot data showed that only doxycycline inhibited MMP-2 expression, whereas both drugs decreased Erk1/2 phosphorylation. When combined, only one of nine mice died within the 30-week study; aortic histology and diameter were normalized and the effects on Smad2 phosphorylation was additive. To further explore the role of MMP-2 in MFS, we created MMP-2-deficient Fbn1mgR/mgR mice. MMP-2 deletion inhibited activation of TGF-$\beta$ and phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Smad2 and prolonged the lifespan of the mice. Conclusions: These studies demonstrated that inhibition of MMP-2 by doxycycline delayed the manifestations of MFS, in part, through its ability to decrease active TGF-$\beta$ and the noncanonical signaling cascade downstream of TGF-$\beta$. This study further suggested that targeting TGF-$\beta$ signaling at different points might be a more effective strategy for inhibiting disease progression. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {We consider a variational formulation of quasi-static brittle fracture and develop a new finite-element-based computational framework for propagation of cracks in three-dimensional bodies. We outline a consistent thermodynamical framework for crack propagation in elastic solids and show that both the elastic equilibrium response as well as the local crack evolution follow in a natural format by exploitation of a global Clausius-Planck inequality in the sense of Coleman's method. Consequently, the crack propagation direction associated with the classical Griffith criterion is identified by the material configurational force which maximizes the local dissipation at the crack front. The variational formulation is realized numerically by a standard spatial discretization with finite elements which yields a discrete formulation of the global dissipation in terms configurational nodal forces. Therefore, the constitutive setting of crack propagation in the space-discretized finite element context is naturally related to discrete nodes of a typical finite element mesh. In a consistent way with the node-based setting, the discretization of the evolving crack discontinuity is performed by the doubling of critical nodes and interface facets of the mesh. The crucial step for the success of this procedure is its embedding into an r-adaptive crack-facet reorientation procedure based on configurational-force-based indicators in conjunction with crack front constraints. We propose a staggered solution procedure that results in a sequence of positive definite discrete subproblems with successively decreasing overall stiffness, providing a robust algorithmic setting in the postcritical range. The predictive capabilitiy of the proposed formulation is demonstrated by means of representative numerical simulations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {One of the distinguishing features of elastomeric materials, which consist of a network of flexible polymeric chains, is that the deformation response is dominated by changes in entropy. Accordingly, most classical theories of rubber-like elasticity consider only the entropy and neglect any changes in internal energy. On the other hand, the fracture of strongly cross-linked elastomers is essentially energy dominated, as argued in the well-known Lake–Thomas model for the toughness of elastomers. However, a single model unifying these two phenomena is still lacking. We provide a rational yet simple model for deformation and fracture of cross-linked polymers, based on two ingredients: (i) a non-Gaussian statistical mechanics model of polymer chains that accounts for the increase in energy due to the deformation of molecular bonds; (ii) a chain scission criterion based on the bond deformation energy attaining a critical value. Using this model, we can estimate the rupture stretch of elastomeric materials from fundamental quantities describing the polymer network. We use this model to relate the flaw sensitivity of elastomers to an intrinsic material length scale related to the network structure.},

We find, that for nearly incompressible materials transverse wave velocities exhibit strong dependence on the direction of propagation and initial strain state, whereas the longitudinal wave velocity is not affected significantly until extreme levels of deformation are attained. For highly compressible materials, we show that both longitudinal and transversal wave velocities depend strongly on deformation and direction of propagation. Moreover, the dependence becomes stronger when stiffening effects increase. When compression is applied, the longitudinal wave velocity decreases regardless the direction of wave propagation in highly compressible materials, and increases for most of the directions in materials with negative Poisson's ratio behaviour.

abstract = {We present simulations of 3 D dynamic fracture which suggest that a persistent elastic wave is generated in response to a localized perturbation of a propagating crack front, e.g., by a local heterogeneity of critical fracture energy. The wave propagates along the moving crack front and spreads, relative to its origin point on the fractured surface, at a speed slightly below the Rayleigh speed. The simulations were done using the spectral elastodynamic methodology of Geubelle and Rice (1995). They model failure by a displacement -weakening cohesive model, which corresponds in the singular crack limit to crack growth at a critical fracture energy. Confirmation that crack front waves with properties like in our simulation do exist has been provided by Ramanathan and Fisher (1997). Through a derivation based on the linearized perturbation analysis of dynamic singular tensile crack growth by Willis and Movchan (1995), those authors found by numerical evaluation that a transfer function thereby introduced has a simple pole at a certain $\omega$/k ratio, corresponding to a non-dispersive wave. Further, we show that as a consequence of these persistent waves, when a crack grows through a region of small random fluctuations in fracture energy, the variances of both the local propagation velocity and the deformed slope of the crack front increase, according to linearized perturbation theory, in direct proportion to distance of growth into the randomly heterogeneous region. That rate of disordering is more rapid than the growth of the variances with the logarithm of distance established by Perrin and Rice (1994) for a model elastodynamic fracture theory based on a scalar wave equation. That scalar case, which shows slowly decaying (as t-1/2) rather than persistent crack front waves, is analyzed here too. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In the first paper crack initiation resulting from stress wave loading to the crack tip and crack arrest were investigated. It was found that for increasing rates of loading in the micro second range, the stress intensity required for initiation rises markedly. Crack arrest occurs abruptly without any deceleration phase at a stress intensity below that value which causes initiation under quasi-static loading.},

abstract = {Phase-field models have the advantage in that no geometric descriptions of cracks are required, which means that crack coalescence and branching can be treated without additional effort. Miehe and Sch{\"{a}}nzel, 2014 introduced a rate-independent phase-field damage model for finite strains in which a viscous damage regularization was proposed. We extend the model to depend on the loading rate and time by incorporating rubber's strain-rate dependency in the constitutive description of the bulk, as well as in the damage driving force. The parameters of the model are identified using experiments at different strain rates. Local strain fields near the crack tip, obtained with digital image correlation (DIC), are used to help identify the length scale parameter. Three different degradation functions are assessed for their accuracy to model the rubber's rate-dependent fracture. An adaptive time-stepping approach with a corrector scheme is furthermore employed to increase the computational efficiency with a factor of six, whereas an active set method guarantees the irreversibility of damage. Results detailing the energy storage and dissipation of the different model constituents are included, as well as validation results that show promising capabilities of rate-dependent phase-field modeling.},

Within an effectively infinite medium, a crack's dynamics perfectly correspond to inertialess behavior predicted by linear elastic fracture mechanics. Once a crack interacts with waves that it generated at earlier times, this description breaks down. Cracks then acquire inertia and sluggishly accelerate. Crack inertia increases with crack speed v and diverges as v approaches its limiting value. We show that these dynamics are in excellent accord with an equation of motion derived in the limit of an infinite strip [M. Marder, Phys. Rev. Lett. 66, 2484 (1991)].},

abstract = {Acoustoelastic analysis has usually been applied to compressible engineering materials. Many materials (e.g., rubber and biologic materials) are "nearly" incompressible and often assumed incompressible in their constitutive equations. These material models do not admit dilatational waves for acoustoelastic analysis. Other constitutive models (for these materials) admit compressibility but still do not model dilatational waves with fidelity (shown herein). In this article a new strain energy function is formulated to model dilatational wave propagation in nearly incompressible, isotropic materials. This strain energy function requires four material constants and is a function of Cauchy-Green deformation tensor invariants. This function and existing (compressible) strain energy functions are compared based upon their ability to predict dilatational wave propagation in uniaxially prestressed rubber. Results demonstrate deficiencies in existing functions and the usefulness of our new function for acoustoelastic applications. Our results also indicate that acoustoelastic analysis has great potential for the accurate prediction of active or residual stresses in nearly incompressible materials.

abstract = {Methods of quasi-static deformation and fracture analysis are developed for a class of nonlinear viscoelastic media and sample applications are given. Selection of the class of media is guided by actual rheological behavior of monolithic and composite materials as well as the need for simplicity to be able to understand the effect of primary material and continuum parameters on crack growth behavior. First, pertinent aspects of J integral and energy release rate theory for nonlinear elastic media are discussed. Nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive equations are then given, and correspondence principles which establish a simple relationship between mechanical states of elastic and viscoelastic media are developed. These principles provide the basis for the subsequent extension of J integral theory to crack growth in viscoelastic materials. Emphasis is on predicting mechanical work available at the crack tip for initiation and continuation of growth; some examples show how viscoelastic properties and the J integral affect growth behavior. Included is the problem of a crack in a thin layer having different viscoelastic properties than the surrounding continuum. The Appendix gives an apparently new constitutive theory for elastic and viscoelastic materials with changing microstructure (e.g. distributed damage) and indicates the conditions under which the fracture theory in the body of the paper is applicable.},

The simplest case to consider is that of elastomeric materials which can undergo large reversible deformations with negligible rate dependence. In this paper we develop a theory for modeling progressive damage and rupture of such materials. We extend the phase-field method, which is widely used to describe the damage and fracture of brittle materials, to elastomeric materials undergoing large deformations. A central feature of our theory is the recognition that the free energy of elastomers is not entirely entropic in nature — there is also an energetic contribution from the deformation of the bonds in the chains. It is the energetic part in the free energy which is the driving force for progressive damage and fracture.},

abstract = {A computational modeling technique for fracture propagation in viscoelastic materials using cohesive elements for the zone ahead of the crack tip is presented. The computational technique is used to study the problem of increase in fracture energy with peel velocity in peel testing of polymers. A rate-independent phenomenological cohesive zone model is used to model the intrinsic fracture toughness of the interface between the polymer sheets. A dimensional analysis reveals that the macroscopic fracture energy scales with the intrinsic fracture toughness and is a function of peel velocity, and parameters such as the thickness, bulk properties of the polymer sheets, and other cohesive zone properties. The growth of fracture energy as a function of the peel velocity has been studied for polymer sheets characterized by a standard linear viscoelastic solid. Viscoelastic losses in the peel arm vanish in the limits of very slow and rapid peeling. Peak dissipation is obtained at an intermediate velocity, which is related to the characteristic relaxation time and thickness. This behavior is interpreted in terms of the size of elastic and viscous zones near the crack tip. It is found that the total energy dissipated is dependent upon both the intrinsic fracture toughness and the characteristic opening displacement of the cohesive zone model. The computational framework has been used to model experimental data on peeling of Butadiene rubbers. It is found that the usual interpretation of these data, that the macroscopic dissipation equals the rate-independent intrinsic toughness multiplied by a factor that depends on rate of loading, leads to a large quantitative discrepancy between theory and experiment. It is proposed that a model based on a rate-dependent cohesive law be used to model these peel tests. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Knauss2015,
abstract = {This review is written in honor of Max L. Williams who not only started this International Journal of Fracture (the author's Ph.D. advisor. Originally the Journal was called International Journal of Fracture Mechanics) but who had a seminally fundamental influence on the course of fracture mechanics in general, and specifically as applied to the time dependent failure of elastomers/polymers. In view of that background this article reviews developments over more than 50 years, as colored by my own experiences in regard to this topic. It seems appropriate to include a historical perspective that starts during pre-journal times and addresses the need for understanding time dependent processes governing fracture in rate sensitive materials. To the largest extent, the rate dependence is important where polymers are involved, though under more limited conditions metals and igneous solids as well as ligneous ones exhibit time dependent fracture characteristics. Such facts notwithstanding, the major discussion in this contribution is devoted here to the time dependent fracture of polymeric materials, and elastomeric ones in particular. The emphasis will be thus on time dependent issues governed primarily by the fracture processes in elastomeric solids, which have evolved largely in parallel to problems devoted to the more rigid polymers. Because consideration of fracture of the rigid polymers has often, if not usually, minimized the time dependence, only cursory attention is paid to these, in spite of the fact that they constitute a very important class of materials in the modern engineering community. From an engineering perspective this review is motivated also by an exposition of a persistent lack of knowledge concerning time dependent fracture issues. Most of the work attached to the notion of viscoelastic fracture is—intentionally or by omission—associated with the phenomenon of crack growth under steady state conditions with the expectation that this understanding leads implicitly to resolution of problems governed by transient loadings. Besides reviewing the historical evolution of the knowledge in this field over the past half century, it is a main purpose of this paper to offer information that has either been ignored or has not been explored (this includes the work of the author), but which contradicts this “popular” perception. It is thus an intentionally large part of this presentation which documents compelling motivation for addressing fracture aspects, that are generally important from an engineering design and analysis point-of-view: specifically, it is intended to illustrate the remarkable degree by which the steady state solution to crack propagation deviates from experimental information when transient conditions prevail, and the large range of time scales over which this failure behavior is observed.},

To retrieve a well-posed problem, the material state is described through the gradients of damage in addition to the strain and the damage. Under some assumptions, it is shown that these gradient laws can be cast into a variational formulation. Its numerical treatment is reduced to the design of a mixed finite element so that algorithms such as Newton's method and path-following techniques are still available. Possible convergence difficulties related to the reduction of the damage band width and the appearance of micro instabilities are removed thanks to the design of a new class of brittle laws. Finally, numerical applications show the convergence with mesh refinement, the compatibility with coarser approaches such as Griffith's theory and cohesive crack models, the robustness in case of unstable multi-cracking, the applicability to full-scale 3D situations and the physical relevance compared to experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Phase-field models have been a topic of much research in recent years. Results have shown that these models are able to produce complex crack patterns in both two and three dimensions. A number of extensions from brittle to ductile materials have been proposed and results are promising. To date, however, these extensions have not accurately represented strains after crack initiation or included important aspects of ductile fracture such as stress triaxiality. This work introduces a number of contributions to further develop phase-field models for fracture in ductile materials. These contributions include: a cubic degradation function that provides a stress–strain response prior to crack initiation that more closely approximates linear elastic behavior, a derivation of the governing equations in terms of a general energy potential from balance laws that describe the kinematics of both the body and phase-field, introduction of a yield surface degradation function that provides a mechanism for plastic softening and corrects the non-physical elastic deformations after crack initiation, a proposed mechanism for including a measure of stress triaxiality as a driving force for crack initiation and propagation, and a correction to an error in the configuration update of an elastoplastic return-mapping algorithm for J2 flow theory. We also present a heuristic time stepping scheme that facilitates computations that require a relatively long load time prior to crack initiation. A number of numerical results will be presented that demonstrate the effects of these contributions.},

@article{Kubo2017,
abstract = {Experiments of crack propagation in rubbers have shown that a discontinuous jump of crack propagation velocity can occur as energy release rate increases, which is known as the "mode transition" phenomenon. Although it is believed that the mode transition is strongly related to the mechanical properties, the nature of the mode transition had not been revealed. In this study, dynamic crack propagation on an elastomer was investigated using the finite element method (FEM) with a hyperviscoelastic material model. A series of pure shear test was carried out numerically with FEM simulations and crack velocities were measured under various values of tensile strain. As a result, our FEM simulations successfully reproduced the mode transition. The success of realising the mode transition phenomenon by a simple FEM model, which was achieved for the first time ever, helped to explain that the phenomenon occurs owing to a characteristic non-monotonic temporal development of principal stress near the crack tip. Rubbers, or elastomers, have exotic mechanical properties, such as entropic elasticity, viscosity and incompress-ibility. Due to such properties rubbers find various industrial applications, e.g., tyres, dampers, etc. From the viewpoint of industry, it is important to understand the fracture mechanism of rubbers for better design of reliable rubber products. The relationship between the velocity of the crack propagation and the energy release rate has been vigorously investigated as a fundamental property to evaluate how easily rubber products are damaged under external loading. A large number of studies have been carried out to investigate the dynamic crack propagation in rubber materials, including experiments 1-6 , theoretical studies 7-11 and numerical analyses 12-18. Some experiments for the crack propagation in rubbers reported an interesting phenomenon: The crack velocity shows a discontinuous jump as energy release rate increases, which is called a "mode transition" 5,6. There are two mode regions, namely the "slow mode" with low crack velocity at low energy release rates and the "fast mode" with high crack velocity at high energy release rates. The two propagation modes show distinct features such as roughness on the crack surface, which implies highly complicated physics behind the mode transition. The mode transition phenomenon is industrially important because it is empirically known that the property of the mode transition is related to lifetime of rubber products; i.e., the higher the transition energy (energy release rate at the mode transition) becomes, the higher durability the rubber has. There is another kind of transition of the crack propagation in rubber materials that occurs at the vicinity of the sound speed (subsonic-supersonic transition) and has been investigated intensively 16,19,20-22. The mechanism of the subsonic-supersonic transition is theoretically well explained 16,20 and this phenomenon has been reproduced successfully by numerical simulations 16,22. On the other hand, the mechanism of the slow-fast mode transition, which is found around the crack velocity much lower than the sound speed in the material, has not been revealed because of the lack of a simple model to reproduce the phenomenon. While Carbone and Persson 11 have theoretically explained the discontinuity of the mode transition through the effect of the locally high temperature ("hot crack"), their explanation stands only when the crack grows very fast and, in reality, the mode transition can be observed at a low crack velocity. In addition, the hot crack model presupposes a quite high temperature on the crack tip. Thus, there is still room for discussion about the mechanism of the slow-fast mode transition on the dynamic crack propagation in rubbers.},

abstract = {Soft viscoelastic polymers and gels are commonly used a wide range of applications owing to their softness and the ability to accommodate large deformations. Their applicability is however often limited by their tendency to fracture in ways that are cannot be predicted by conventional elastic fracture mechanics. Our understanding of fracture in this class of solid has particularly been hindered by the incapacity of determining the competition viscous flow and fracture under finite strains. To tackle this problem, this paper presents a framework that quantitatively captures the interplay between energy dissipation and crack propagation in soft solids made of a single transient network. Using a combined analytical and numerical study, we investigate the dynamics of crack propagation at various loading rates and for networks that display different sensitivities to force. Our results point out to four different crack characteristic behaviors, for which we unveiled the respective mechanisms, all involving a strong interplay between chain deformation, bond dynamics and rupture.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the applicability of the Time-Temperature Superposition Principle in the dynamic response of a polyurea polymer at high strain rates and different temperatures. Careful and extensive measurements in the time domain of the relaxation behavior and subsequent deduction of a master-relaxation curve establish the mechanical behavior for quasistatic deformations over a time range of 16 decades. To examine its validity in a highly dynamic environment, experiments with the aid of a split Hopkinson (Kolsky) pressure bar are carried out. The use of a two-material pulse shaper allows for stress equilibrium across the specimen during the compression process, to concentrate on the initial, small deformation part that characterizes linearly viscoelastic behavior. This behavior of polyurea at high strain rates and different temperatures is then investigated by comparing results from a physically fully three-dimensional (axisymmetric) numerical model, employing the quasistatically obtained properties, with corresponding Hopkinson bar measurements. The experimentally determined wave history entering the specimen is used as input to the model. Experimental and simulation results are compared with each other to demonstrate that the Time-Temperature Superposition Principle can indeed provide the requisite data for high strain rate loading of viscoelastic solids, at least to the extent that linear viscoelasticity applies with respect to the polyurea material. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Investigations of the processes of crack propagation have continued now for a considerable period of time, and it would be fair to say that in the field of stationary propagation of cracks the investigations have more or less reached completion. One of the simplest problems of nonstationary propagation of cracks would appear to be the problem of the widening at constant velocity of a rectilinear crack in a uniform stress field perpendicular to the line of the crack. This problem has been investigated by a number of authors, starting with Mott [1], but it was not until the paper by Broberg [2] that it was treated as a problem of the dynamic theory of elasticity. Broberg, however, neglected the effect of cohesive forces, and for this reason came to the conclusion that the uniform propagation of cracks can take place only at a velocity equal to the velocity of propagation of Rayleigh surface waves: at any other velocity an uncompensated singularity occurs in the stress field at the end of the crack. The present paper investigates on the basis of certain assumptions the effect of cohesive forces and derives an equation which defines the velocity of propagation of a crack in terms of the applied stress. It is shown that for every material there is a certain minimum velocity of stable uniform crack propagation. It is also shown that the velocity of stable propagation of a crack increases with increase in the splitting force and tends to the Rayleigh velocity: it would appear that in isotropic bodies the formation of a regime of uniform propagation at the Rayleigh velocity is prevented by the occurrence of branching of the crack. {\textcopyright} 1962.},

abstract = {At high crack velocities in metallic materials nearly all plastic strain accumulates at very high strain-rates, typically in the range 103 s−1 to 105 s−1. At these rates, dislocation motion is limited by dynamic lattice effects and the plastic strain-rate increases approximately linearly with stress. The problem for a crack growing at high velocity is posed for steady-state, small scale yielding in elastic/rate-dependent plastic solids. A general expression is derived for the near-tip stress intensity factor in terms of the remote intensity factor, or equivalently for the near-tip energy release-rate in terms of the overall release-rate. An approximate calculation of the plastic strain-rates provides this relation in analytical form. Imposition of the condition that the near-tip energy release-rate be maintained at a critical value provides a propagation equation for the growing crack. A single, nondimensional combination of material constants emerges as the controlling parameter. Implications for dynamic crack propagation are discussed.},

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to present a general framework for constitutive viscoelastic models in finite strain regime. The approach is qualified as variational since the constitutive updates obey a minimum principle within each load increment. The set of internal variables is strain-based and employs, according to the specific model chosen, a multiplicative decomposition of strain into elastic and viscous components. The present approach shares the same technical procedures used for analogous models of plasticity or viscoplasticity, such as the solution of a minimization problem to identify inelastic updates and the use of exponential mapping for time integration. However, instead of using the classical decomposition of inelastic strains into amplitude and direction, we take advantage of a spectral decomposition that provides additional facilities to accommodate, into simple analytical expressions, a wide set of specific models. Moreover, appropriate choices of the constitutive potentials allow the reproduction of other formulations in the literature. The final part of the paper presents a set of numerical examples in order to explore the characteristics of the formulation as well as its applicability to usual large-scale FEM analyses.

To this end, a two-field Lagrangian weak formulation in which cohesive tractions are chosen as the field variables along the crack's path is presented. Unfortunately, this formulation cannot model the infinite compliance of the broken elements accurately, and no simple criterion can be defined to determine the loading-unloading change of state at the integration points of the cohesive elements. Therefore, a modified Lagrangian formulation using a fictitious cohesive traction instead of the classical cohesive traction as the field variable is proposed. Thanks to this change of variable, the cohesive law becomes an increasing function of the equivalent displacement jump, which eliminates the problems mentioned previously. The ability of the proposed formulations to simulate fracture accurately and without field oscillations is investigated through three numerical test examples. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Continuum mechanics allows one to establish constitutive relations, deducing them from a single pair of scalar functions characterizing the material. The simplest materials dealt with in continuum mechanics are elastic. More general processes and those taking place in more general materials are irreversible and require more constitutive relations, connecting the dissipative forces with the velocities. The orthogonality condition and the equivalent extremum principles have been established for velocities in the form of vectors or symmetric tensors. It is found that if the deformation of an elastic body is neither isothermal nor adiabatic, the strain tensor has to be supplemented by the additional independent state variable. The connection between stress and elastic strain is given by the generalized Hooke's law and connects the stress with the plastic strain and its time rate. It is found that orthogonality in velocity space, which is essentially responsible for the results, does not necessarily imply orthogonality in force space. {\textcopyright} 1987, Academic Press Inc.},

Both conditions allow to precisely control the crack propagation speed and to test the predictions of existing theories. By employing the new set-up we measure the energy release rate as a function of the crack propagation speed. We also measure with a high precision infrared camera the increase of temperature at the crack tip, showing that, notwithstanding the low speed regime considered during the experiments, the viscoelastic dissipation at the crack tip leads to a measurable temperature increase of about 1 °C. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

An implementation of the configurational forces into the finite element is presented. The newly proposed C-force criterion is further validated through a series of examples. It is concluded that the predictions of mixed-mode crack propagation by C-force criterion are in good agreement with experimental data in the open literatures. In addition, an experimental procedure on evaluation the configurational forces is proposed by using the digital image correlation.

@article{Jia2012,
abstract = {Continuum mechanics predicts that the propagation speed of non-equilibrium information in solids is limited by the longitudinal wave speed, so is crack propagation. However, solids are essentially discrete systems. In this paper, via theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, it is demonstrated in a straightforward way that non-equilibrium disturbance (e.g. force, displacement, energy, and so on) can propagate at a supersonic speed in discrete systems, although the magnitude of the disturbance attenuates very quickly. In dynamic fracture, a cascade of atomic-bond breaking events provides an amplification mechanism to counterbalance the attenuation of the disturbance. Therefore, supersonic crack propagation can be realized in a domino way. Another key factor for supersonic crack propagation is to ensure sufficient energy flowing into the crack tip. Since most energy can only be transferred at a speed limited by the longitudinal wave speed, the conditions for the occurrence of supersonic crack propagation are not easily met in most situations, unless there is high pre-stored energy along the crack path or continuous energy supply from the loading concomitantly moving with the crack tip. A quantitative relation between supersonic crack propagation speed and material properties and parameters is given, which implies that knowing all the classical macroscopic quantities is not enough in determining the supersonic crack propagation speed, and the microstructure does play a role. Moreover, it is interesting to note that fracture toughness affects the crack propagation speed in the subsonic regime, but not in the supersonic regime, because the deformation/stress is uniform in front of a supersonic crack where strength criterion dominates.},

These idealized models do not mimic realistic microstructure, but can be solved exactly and understood completely. First it is shown that constant velocity crack solutions do not exist at all for a range of velocities starting at zero and ranging up to about one quarter of the shear wave speed. Next it is shown that above this speed cracks are by and large linearly stable, but that at sufficiently high velocity they become unstable with respect to a nonlinear microcracking instability. The way this instability works itself out is related to the scenario known as intermittency, and the basic time scale which governs it is the inverse of the amount of dissipation in the model. Finally, we compare the theoretical framework with some new experiments in Plexiglas, and show that all qualitative features of the theory are mirrored in our experimental results.},

Whereas the increase of tearing energy at higher crack tip velocities can be ascribed to the shear behavior, bulk behavior influences the fracture mechanism. The results support experimental investigations that the instability separating stable from unstable crack propagation is related to a change in the fracture mechanism. At low crack tip velocities, material separation is the result of formation, growth, and coalescence of cavities. At high crack tip velocities, cavitation is suppressed and fracture is driven by a rather brittle mechanism resulting in a decreased amount of energy to propagate the fracture process zone. {\textcopyright} 2008 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract = {A material force method is proposed for evaluating the energy release rate and work rate of dissipation for fracture in inelastic materials. The inelastic material response is characterized by an internal variable model with an explicitly defined free energy density and dissipation potential. Expressions for the global material and dissipation forces are obtained from a global balance of energy–momentum that incorporates dissipation from inelastic material behavior. It is shown that in the special case of steady-state growth, the global dissipation force equals the work rate of dissipation, and the global material force and J-integral methods are equivalent. For implementation in finite element computations, an equivalent domain expression of the global material force is developed from the weak form of the energy–momentum balance. The method is applied to model problems of cohesive fracture in a remote K-field for viscoelasticity and elastoplasticity. The viscoelastic problem is used to compare various element discretizations in combination with different schemes for computing strain gradients. For the elastoplastic problem, the effects of cohesive and bulk properties on the plastic dissipation are examined using calculations of the global dissipation force.},
